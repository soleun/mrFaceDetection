<heading id="h-0005" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention generally relates to an electronic table game system that may have one or more dealer's electronic interfaces connected to a computer system <b>38</b> that could allow the input and processing of table game play and wagering by one or more dealers. More specifically, an electronic table gaming system that generally provides table game play with a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, which optionally could further feature a predetermined maximum payout amount or &#x201c;cap&#x201d;.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For most of history, many gaming establishments have provided a category of gaming that utilized some form of a gaming table. This category of games, known as table games, could employ one or more dealers and include one or more game elements (e.g., playing cards, dice, balls, and the like) employed upon a playing surface of a gaming table. This category could include card games (e.g., blackjack, pai gow, poker, baccarat, and the like) and non-card games (e.g., roulette, craps, and the like). This category of games, unlike the gaming of electronic gaming machines (EGMs) (e.g., slot machines, fully automated dealer-less electronic table games and the like) and the like, provided players with the warm touch of human interaction encapsulated within the bonds of gaming camaraderie, in which intelligent players gathered socially to match wits against other worthy opponents (e.g., players) as well as the dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite the wonderful human bonding experience of table-based games, the cold, hand-pulling world of electronic gaming machines (e.g., slot machines) is beginning to seriously displace table-based games (e.g., craps, roulette, and card games such as blackjack, pai gow, poker, and baccarat) in many gaming establishments. One reason for this displacement could be that electronic gaming machines (and the like), through their now electronic operating systems, can be coupled into a unifying computer-based system, which can offer either single or a multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot features that are very popular with the players. These single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot games can collect small percentages of the players' bets (or wagers) from numerous slot machines located over a wide area of locations and diverts them into a &#x201c;larger payout pool&#x201d; or jackpot, which may accumulate quite quickly. This &#x201c;larger payout pool&#x201d; or jackpot is won when a player bets the required maximum bet amount and the wheels of the slot machine land on a predetermined winning criterion on the machine. These single/multi-tier progressive jackpots can offer to the individual players of a networked electronic gaming machine (and the like) a chance of winning a much greater payout than could be practical through an isolated electronic gaming machine (and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, a progressive jackpot for electronic gaming machines (and the like), known as &#x201c;MEGABUCKS&#xae;&#x201d;, enables players to win in excess of seven million dollars; however, players are only eligible for this large jackpot if they wager the maximum bet. If the players wager less than the maximum bet and the winning MEGABUCKS&#xae; symbols appear on the pay line, he or she wins a much smaller jackpot.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Large payoff single/multi-tier bonuses (e.g., MEGABUCKS&#xae; or POWERBALL&#xae;) are accumulated progressively, and it usually takes a considerable length of time (such as weeks or even months) for a player to win the large MEGABUCKS&#xae; award. This is generally because the mathematical odds of winning the MEGABUCKS&#xae; award are in excess of thirty million to one (30,000,000:1). In contrast, other progressive electronic gaming machines (and the like) (e.g., WHEEL OF FORTUNE&#xae;, TOTEM POLE&#xae;, and video draw poker) offer what are known as &#x201c;instant bonus payouts&#x201d; where a player can win after each spin of the reels; however, the bonus amounts are usually quite small. Table gaming on the other hand, has traditionally been unable to be electronically networked together because table gaming has generally relied upon human interaction for providing one or more actions of the game, which may determine the outcome of the play (e.g., a dealer rolling a ball on a roulette wheel, a dealer dealing out cards, a player rolling dice in the game of craps, and the like) generally making it hard to convert or report such actions or corresponding results into an electronic data format that can be readily electronically processed/analyzed/stored/and/or retrieved. An electronic gaming machine (and the like) on the other hand, having game play generated within an electronic environment generally uses electronic means to report play outcome and can thus readily have the play outcome and the like presented in an electronic data format for electronic processing/analyzing/storing and/or retrieving. Because of the limitations that may be found in many current technologies in trying to passively convert the game action and wagering of a table game into an electronic data format that can be handled by an computer system <b>38</b>, it has been difficult to provide table games with the exciting and game-enhancing benefits that a computer system <b>38</b> can provide, such as single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot features, smart card technologies, player-loyalty reward systems, player tracking systems, game play wager tracking, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although table games have, in the past, had the limited ability to put forth (and receive) electronic data relating to their action and wagering (e.g., like the capability of electronic gaming machines [and the like] and their associated electronic system), gaming establishments have not been able to make use of this already-collected data to its fullest extent or much less expand on the types of data mined (as they do with electronic gaming machines and the like). If data mining capacity, and the data mining expansion capability could be associated with information obtained through the invention, then there could be the creation of one or more databases for table game play and wagering (along with its associated inner-gaming establishment commerce possibilities). This data mining could become a very powerful and important tool in the gaming industry because it could allow a gaming establishment to obtain much needed player and game information to properly suit or alter the table gaming environment, action, wagering, and the like to generally provide a tremendous increase in the gaming enjoyment of its table-game-playing patrons. Furthermore, such an expanded dataset and data collection capability may be altered and applied beyond the gaming table arena (e.g., gaming table data and gaming table analysis models and methodologies could be applied to electronic gaming machines and/or other gaming devices within any gaming establishment). This data mining may include recording and processing immediate and historical game play (e.g., how often certain card combinations occur; player strategies, how fast a dealer is &#x201c;running&#x201d; a table [e.g., &#x201c;game turnover&#x201d;]; the overall performance of the various types of gaming tables (e.g., average bet by player, table, pit, game etc); headcount data (e.g., players playing per hour, day, month, year, etc); wagering (e.g., how profitable the game is to the gaming establishment; what types of game wagers are most popular with players (e.g., in craps, many players may like to place field bets rather than bets on the &#x201c;don't pass&#x201d; area, so gaming establishment operators might use this information to invoke special incentives in order to encourage players to bet on other table options offered by the table [rather than field bets]); determination of the individual player's wagering habits (e.g., betting and/or strategy data and the like) and/or player preferences/dislikes (e.g., building a player profile to best serve that player, etc.); and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such database building could provide the gaming establishment with the ability to tremendously increase the players' enjoyment of gaming tables (and thereby gaming establishment operators' profits), even more so than could generally be accomplished with electronic gaming machines (and the like). Wherein electronic gaming machines (and the like) are generally seen as a solitary relation (e.g., one player to one electronic gaming machines [and the like]), gaming tables can accommodate several players at once thereby providing a gaming environment whereby human psychology of group dynamics may occur (e.g., a &#x201c;fire&#x201d; or &#x201c;hot action&#x201d; craps table often draws in more players, something which an electronic gaming machine [and the like], with its one-to-one dynamic, generally does not). If a gaming table could be provided with electronic data capacity and networking capability similar to that of an electronic gaming machine (and the like) system, then theoretically, the gaming establishment could possibly better manage the gaming environment of a group of players through one electronic gaming table machine both on collective and on individual levels. For example, if a craps table could have the electronic data capacity and networking capability similar to that of an electronic gaming machine (and the like) system, then gaming establishments could possibly detect a hot action craps table and then possibly electronically alter the payback odds (in accordance with applicable regulatory and jurisdictional laws and regulations) (e.g., lowering the payback odds from 40 to 1 to 7 to 1) for or against the house to possibly control or guide the &#x201c;fire&#x201d; to maximize its effect on increasing player gaming enjoyment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additionally, if gaming tables could be electronically interfaced or otherwise linked to a central server, the gaming establishment could place a whole host of services, comps, gratuities, and the like at the fingertips of gaming table players (as is possible with electronic gaming machines). These enticements could enhance immediate gaming pleasure as well as provide incentives for the player to share information with the gaming establishment (to help the gaming establishment improve their services and/or further bolster their data processing/analyzing/storing and/or retrieving activities) and to improve the player's long term gaming experience at the gaming establishment as well.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the past, when gaming innovators have attempted to incorporate various types of electronic features and/or interfaces, these electronic features and/or interfaces acted more as an interference force&#x2014;seriously disrupting the flow of play and substantially leading to serious diminishment of the players' gaming enjoyment thereby resulting in decreased player participation as well as gaming establishments' profitability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As electronic gaming machines (and the like) continue to cut into areas of table-based gaming, gaming establishments could see a continued resulting economic loss of those revenues traditionally bought in by those players who value games that require skill (e.g., card games, craps, and roulette) or those players who value the human social interaction that may be provided by traditional table gaming.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an attempt to aid gaming establishments in their efforts to reduce the costs of operating gaming tables, gaming manufactures have been steadily employing the use of electronic means while simultaneously reducing the importance and even the presence of human interaction (which is generally provided in gaming table action). Generally speaking, the current trend for multiplayer gaming (e.g., gaming tables) technology is to try for full automation and control of gaming tables to the point where the use of an actual human dealer is eliminated. These attempts try to use various electronic technologies to translate physical human activities of the game play into electronic data that can be processed/analyzed/stored and/or retrieved by a computer system <b>38</b>. Some of these systems also attempt to use one or more different variations of a game element reader (e.g., the Shufflemaster&#xae; iShoe&#x2122;, and the like) and player recognition technology in their products.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Current electronic table gaming technology, even while employing the most current, up-to-date, state-of-the-art, high-tech game element readers <b>36</b> (e.g., the Shufflemaster&#xae; iShoe&#x2122;, Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; or other surface computing platforms, and the like) and player recognition technologies, is still in the developmental stage. These technologies generally lack the capabilities needed to consistently and correctly determine which player or dealer has received what cards (or other game elements). This general inability may be seen as a potentially severe limitation to successful deployment and use of such computer system <b>38</b><i>s </i>with gaming table play and wagering. Present efforts appear to try to primarily rely on technology alone to solve the problems associated with gaming table automation. It appears that full automation of gaming tables may not yet be successful without some deployment of sound human judgment, facilitation, and management within the gaming table play and wagering.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another aspect of gaming tables is the utilization of gaming chips for wagering activities. The gaming industry has invested enormous resources toward the process of evolving yesteryears' lowly gaming establishment chip into today's technological betting marvel. Chips of the past were manufactured from everything from clay composite to plastic to acrylic composite. Today's chips employ everything from invisible ultraviolet bar codes, computer chips, radio frequency identification chips (RFID), and the like. Additionally, all gaming establishments utilize sophisticated in-house logistic, accounting, and security measures composed of (but not limited to) pit personnel, accountants, and security agents for the transfer, accounting, and tracking of these gaming chips. This all in contrast to the accounting systems of many electronic gaming machines (and the like) that can electronically process and reconcile all associated electronic gaming machine (and the like) wagering.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another limitation in not having gaming tables being electronically linked to a gaming establishment's system can be seen when a player, in order to access his or her electronic account within the gaming establishment, must physically hand over to a dealer or other employees of the gaming establishment their electronic player's club card, smart card, and the like. The gaming establishment employee then has to take the card (generally to another location in the gaming area having an electronic card interface [e.g., a player's monetary device] to the computer system <b>38</b>) to properly access the player's account within the gaming establishment and, if needed, to provide an accreditation to the account for the player's gaming action at the gaming table. Additionally, a player must also discontinue their gaming action at a gaming table (which equates to lost revenue for the gaming establishment) and go to other parts of the gaming establishment whenever the player wishes to engage in non-gaming related establishment services such as: restaurant reservations, room reservations, venue reservations (show, sporting, special events, etc.), cashing out, ordering drinks, recalling their valet-parked vehicle, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">What is needed therefore is generally a system and methodology for an electronic gaming system, wherein the system utilizes a human dealer to observe game table play and/or wagering and to actively transmit one or more of such observations or actions of the dealer to computer system <b>38</b> through one or more dealer's electronic interfaces (e.g., touch screen, touch-sensitive screen, etc.) thus generally allowing the computer system <b>38</b> to process the game play generally in real time. The system may further provide one or more electronic interfaces for a respective player of the gaming table for the identification of the player to the system; the placement of wagers (thereby eliminating physical gaming establishment betting chips) by the player at the gaming table; and the processing of player requests for non-gaming associated services (e.g., ordering a drink, buying tickets to a show, etc) and the like. The invention, in providing one or more of these elements, may allow one or more such electronic gaming tables to be electronically connected or otherwise networked to a computer system <b>38</b> and the coupling of gaming tables with electronic system-based features such as a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot and the like. The invention may further provide for a table game associated single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot further featuring a predetermined maximum payout amount or &#x201c;cap&#x201d; which may generate greater game play interest and excitement.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0082">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part of this application. The drawings show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0083">It could be understood that while the present description may only illustrate a single gaming table version, the present invention could also be implemented with many different versions of gaming tables at one venue as well as with different multiple versions of gaming tables at multiple venues.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0084">One possible embodiment of the invention <b>10</b> could be an electronic table game system <b>20</b> and a methodology or process <b>500</b> for its operation. As substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, one embodiment, an electronic table game system <b>20</b> could be comprised of one or more electronic gaming tables <b>22</b>, of the type generally found within a gaming establishment. Each electronic gaming table <b>22</b> having a playing surface <b>24</b> that could support one or more game elements <b>26</b> (e.g., dice, cards, roulette ball, and the like) for the play of a table game. Proximate to the playing surface <b>24</b> could be one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> as well as one or more player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b>, the interfaces being connected to a computer system <b>38</b> (substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>) that could process data inputted through the interfaces. The dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could generally define the dealer's position and substantially allow a human dealer to at least input data regarding observed actions of the game play of the table game being played upon the electronic gaming table <b>22</b>. The player's electronic interface <b>32</b> could allow a human player to at least input data regarding one or more wagers made by the human player on the table game <b>28</b> being played upon the electronic gaming table <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0085">In at least one embodiment, the invention <b>10</b> could further comprise of one or more player's monetary devices <b>34</b> generally located proximate to the player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b>, (so defining a player position <b>40</b>) and one or more game element readers <b>36</b> generally located proximate to the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. The player's monetary device(s) <b>34</b> and game element reader(s) <b>36</b> are also connected to the computer system <b>38</b>. The player's monetary device <b>34</b> could be used by the player to generally input monetary data that could support the player's wagering activity while the game element reader <b>36</b> could be used to generally input data regarding such factors as; identity, value, time and location of game element(s) <b>26</b> in relation to game play.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0086">The invention <b>10</b>, in providing real time data input capability for game play, wagering, and the like for table games, wherein the data is processed by a computer system <b>38</b>, could allow multiple electronic table games to be electronically linked together forming network that could provide a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot for the linked games. The single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could be further played with a cap or limit, which in combination with the operator's actions could generally increase the chances of winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, and could substantially increase players' participation in the invention <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the invention's data input and processing capability could provide for substantially increased data mining of table games and table game players.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0087">The electronic gaming table <b>22</b> could comprise of a body <b>46</b> that supports a playing surface <b>24</b> upon which game elements <b>26</b> of the table game could be deployed or otherwise supported for the play of the table game. The structure of the gaming table could be generally configured in two types. One type could be configured for the playing of table games using playing cards (e.g., a blackjack, a pai gow, a baccarat, or a poker table and the like) while the other type could be configured for the playing of table games not using playing cards (e.g., a roulette table, a craps table, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0088">In at least one embodiment, the playing surface <b>24</b> could generally be of traditional construction (e.g., a felt surface with game-specific indicia for either playing card or non-playing card table games). In at least one embodiment, the playing surface <b>24</b> could be further adapted to support one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b>, one or more game element readers <b>36</b>, one or more player electronic interfaces, one or more player's monetary devices <b>34</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0089">The electronic gaming table <b>22</b> could further provide for traditional non-gaming accessories. An example of such accessories could include, but not be limited to: one or more chairs for players to sit (not shown), a slot in the table so a dealer could deposit currency <b>24</b> (e.g., cash) into a cash box, a device for storing game elements <b>44</b> (e.g., discarded playing cards), signage or other indicia for communicating to players various information like, but may not be limited to gaming and wagering rules (e.g., minimum/maximum bet requirements, house rules, and the like) (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0090">The dealer's electronic interface(s) <b>30</b> (e.g., a touch screen <b>48</b>) could be designed to allow a human dealer to actively enter in real time data concerning dealer-observed table game play and/or wagering (e.g., where the game elements <b>26</b>, such as cards, are being dealt, game play results, facilitate wagering periods [start/stop], and the like) occurring at a gaming table under the dealer's control. The dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could be so configured to allow the dealer's action of inputting the data to occur without otherwise interrupting or slowing down the flow of gaming table's play (e.g., shuffling of the cards, offering the new shooter the dice, and the like) or the data being processed/analyzed/stored and/or retrieved by an electronic table gaming system.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0091">This dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could be a touch screen <b>48</b> programmed to provide buttons <b>50</b>, icons <b>52</b> (and the like) for the computer illiterate and/or for data entry accuracy/expediency and/or for the ease of training new dealers.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0092">Embodiments of the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> may further be configured and programmed through the computer system <b>38</b> and include various communication devices such as audible indicators (e.g., alarms, bells, and the like); visual indicators (e.g. error messages, statistical data displays [hands per hour, game recall in the case of system malfunction or player dispute, and the like], and the like); password/radio-frequency identification (RFID)-protected screens/screensavers with automatic timeouts; customizable art displays/and or screensavers; various types of overrides based on standardized computer security schemas (e.g., the pit boss could have certain override capabilities to, but not be limited by, the ability to re-boot an individual gaming table and/or certain gaming table components; to transfer a player's or players' current game/game status/gaming history/and the like to a specific gaming table; to fix a dealer's/player's data-entry error; to credit a player's account in the case of a system malfunction/player dispute; and the like); and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0093">Additional embodiments of the Dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> may include dealer identification/security features <b>31</b> that may include, but not be limited to, voice-recognition/activation, biometric interfaces (e.g., fingerprint/retina/DNA scanning), other RFID implementations, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0094">In this manner, the present invention <b>10</b> may generally avoid one of the stumbling blocks for incorporating gaming tables into a computer system <b>38</b>: attempting to substitute a human dealer with passive electronics that attempt to identify and interpret the actions of the players and the dealer as they relate to gaming table activities.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0095">In at least one embodiment, wherein the gaming table's playing surface <b>24</b>, that itself was a touch screen <b>48</b>, a surface computing platform (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like) could also be incorporated into computer system <b>38</b>. This combination of technologies could allow the gaming establishment (utilizing server based technology) to convert the gaming table to from one table game to another (e.g. the playing surface <b>24</b> could change from a blackjack game configuration to one for a pai gow game) simply by downloading/changing to a new game indicia program and the game program.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0096">In operating a table game, the human dealer could be given specific tasks, including but not necessarily limited to: to identify the destination of a game element <b>26</b> (e.g., which player is dealt a specific card); to set up the game (e.g., in the game of craps, offering a tray of dice to the shooter so that he or she may choose a pair, retrieving the dice after the dice have been thrown, and the like. In roulette, these tasks could include spinning the ball on the wheel and the like. In playing card table games, these tasks could include shuffling the cards and placing them into the shoe, and the like); to record the results of game play (e.g., the pips of a die/pair of dice, the number associated with the final resting spot of a ball on a roulette wheel and the like. The dealer could also offer to the player(s) the traditional Vegas-style experience (e.g., companionship and basic human socialization based on the gaming interaction between a dealer and player). Other responsibilities could be tasked to the dealer as deemed necessary by the gaming establishment. To accomplish one or more most of these tasks with the present invention <b>10</b>, the dealer could interact with his or her one or more electronic dealer interfaces (e.g., the dealer inputs the appropriate task-associated data).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0097">In another embodiment of this invention <b>10</b>, all of the tasks assigned to a dealer could be automated with the same type of components as that of an electronic gaming device (e.g., slot machines, fully automated dealer-less electronic table games and the like) with the exception that multiple players could play on one machine as opposed to what occurs on an electronic gaming device, which is a one player-to-one machine interaction. Technology thereby could eliminate the need for a human dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0098">Similarly, in at least one embodiment of the invention <b>10</b>, the computer system <b>38</b> could be programmed so that the functions of the game element reader <b>36</b> (e.g., the determination of what cards the player and dealer are dealt; the final destination of a ball landing on a roulette wheel, the results of thrown dice on a craps table; and the like) could be performed by the electronic devices of the invention <b>10</b> (e.g., the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>). Like an electronic gaming machine, the results of the determination could then be displayed as animation/static display, and the player's account could be credited or debited appropriately. Due to the fact that all of the game elements <b>26</b> (e.g., cards, dice, ball, and the like) could be removed (e.g., they could all be animated), no set up (e.g., the ball being rolled on a roulette wheel, a tray of dice being offered to a shooter, the retrieval of dice after they have been thrown, and the like) of a game is required, and all activities of the game are recorded (as well as processed/analyzed/stored/and/or retrieved) by the computer system <b>38</b> in real-time. Both dealer-based and full computer animated versions of the invention <b>10</b> could provide for the formulation and implementation of a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot with or without a cap. Those with ordinary skill in the art could implement these aforementioned embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0099">As substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>A, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, the dealer's electronic interface(s) <b>30</b> (e.g., touch screens <b>48</b>) could be designed for a human dealer to allow the dealer to actively enter data in real time (e.g., where the cards are being dealt and/or if they have been discarded; game play results [e.g., location of a ball landing on a roulette wheel's space, the pip of a die, and the like]; facilitate wagering periods [e.g., start/stop]; and the like) related to his or her observations regarding an action (e.g., game play) at the electronic gaming table <b>22</b> under the dealer's control without interrupting or slowing down the flow of gaming table's play (e.g., shuffling of the cards, offering the new shooter the dice, and the like). Furthermore any data entered by the dealer could be processed/analyzed/stored and/or retrieved by a computer system <b>38</b>. These one or more electronic interfaces could be flush with the top of the playing surface <b>24</b> and located in proximity to the dealer's ordinary position at the gaming table.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0100">Various versions of the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>, in conjunction with the appropriate programming of the computer system <b>38</b> could be configured to show buttons <b>50</b>, icons <b>52</b> (and the like) for the computer illiterate and/or for data entry accuracy/expediency and/or for the ease of training new dealers. By pressing a button/icon and the like, the dealer could indicate his or her future actions and then take those actions (e.g., in card games, by pressing a button/icon and the like, the dealer could denote the player to whom the card is to be dealt and then deal the card. The dealer could then repeat this action for each player. In non-card games, the dealer could press a button/icon and the like for the purpose of recording game action play).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0101">This dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> may further include, but are not limited to: a dealer reveal icon/button <b>54</b> (which could allow the dealer to indicate to the computer system <b>38</b> that it is time for that dealer to reveal his card(s); a wager lockout button/icon <b>56</b> to manage wagering periods (which could allow the dealer to indicate to players when bets are allowed and when they are not during the game); a point number button/icon <b>58</b> (which could allow the dealer to identify which number is the point number in craps); a blackjack button/icon <b>60</b> (which could allow the dealer to indicate to the system that he or she has a blackjack); a no blackjack button/icon <b>62</b> (which could allow the dealer to indicate to the system that he or she does not have a blackjack); a pit boss button/icon (which could allow the dealer to call the pit boss over to the gaming table for assistance); a dealer override button/icon (which could allow the dealer to take control of the table as a dealer either when a player is finished with his or her turn of being the game's banker or in the event of a system malfunction/player error during the player's turn of being the game's banker); 12 buttons <b>50</b> listing the numbers 1 through 12 individually (which could allow the dealer to enter the results of the roll of a dice <b>64</b> (e.g., a player rolls a 3 and a 4, the dealer could then press the 7 button/icon) <b>66</b>; hard ways buttons <b>50</b>/icons <b>52</b> (e.g., two 2s, two 3s, two 4s, two 5s) (which could allow the dealer to enter rolls of the dice which result in specific number combinations [also known as &#x201c;hard way rolls]); two is (e.g., &#x201c;snake eyes&#x201d;) button <b>50</b>/icons <b>52</b> (which allow the dealer to enter rolls of the dice which result in the specific number combination of two single pips on each die); and two 6s (which allow the dealer to enter rolls of the dice which result in the specific number combination of 6 pips on each die) <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0102">The dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could further feature: audible indicators (e.g., alarms, bells, and the like); visual indicators (e.g. error messages, statistical data displays [e.g., hands per hour, game recall in the case of system malfunction or player dispute, and the like], and the like); password/radio-frequency identification (RFID)-protected screens and/or screensavers (with automatic timeouts) for the purpose of dealer login/logoff security; customizable art displays/and or screensavers; various types of overrides based on standardized computer security schemas (e.g., the pit boss, from a remote location [e.g., the pit boss' terminal located in the center of the gaming pit] could have certain override capabilities to, but not be limited by, the ability to re-boot an individual gaming table and/or certain gaming table components; to transfer a player's or players' current game/game status/gaming history/and the like to a specific gaming table; to fix a dealer's/player's data-entry error (e.g., if the cards were dealt out of sequence according to standard game play rules); to credit a player's account in the case of a system malfunction/player dispute; and the like); and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0103">Other functions of the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could include, but not be limited to, voice-recognition/activation; biometric interfaces (e.g., fingerprint/retina/DNA scanning/and the like); other RFID implementations; Microsoft&#xae; Surface or other surface computing platforms; and the like. This technology may provide the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> to be completely automated so that, rather than manually inputting information; the dealer's actions/thoughts/eye motions/and the like could be automatically read and translated into an electronic format (or automated all together so that a human is not a necessity) to which the system could respond appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0104">For example, surface computing platform technology (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like) could scan currency as it is placed on the table and, if appropriate, based on the dealer's indications, the system could convert it into electronic game play credits and attribute those credits to the correct player's account. The Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; could scan and the system could record all pertinent data about cards as they are withdrawn from a manual shoe/Shufflemaster&#xae; iShoe&#x2122; or the like and could identify to which player they were dealt and/or whether they were discarded. The Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; could automatically scan the bottom pip of a die/dice and the system's servers could calculate the upside pip of the same die/dice. The computer system's servers could then transmit this data back to the computer system's various displays (e.g., electronic signage, Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122;, and the like) and credit/debit the appropriate players' accounts.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0105">The present invention <b>10</b>, in using a human dealer to input action of a table game into a computer system <b>38</b>, may help avoid one of the stumbling blocks for incorporating gaming tables into a computer system <b>38</b>: passive electronics that attempt to identify and interpret the actions of the players and the dealer as they relate to gaming table activities.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0106">As substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the game element reader <b>36</b> could be any device that can read, transmit, and possibly display game element-related data in real time (the game element <b>26</b> may refer to, but is not limited to, cards from one or more decks of playing cards, a pair of dice, a ball, and the like either in physical or electronic format). This device may be the Shufflemaster&#xae; iShoe&#x2122;, the Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; (or some other compatible surface computing platform), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0107">The location where this device could be installed depends upon its form and function for game play. For example, if the game element reader <b>36</b> is an iShoe&#x2122;, it could be located on the table surface in proximity to the dealer. However, if the game element reader <b>36</b> is the Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122;, then it could be the table/playing surface <b>24</b> itself. Once a game element <b>26</b> has been read by the game element reader <b>36</b>, the reader could create an electronic data packet, which could contain, but not be limited to, pertinent game information (e.g., a card's value and suit as it is being removed from a shoe [e.g., the iShoe&#x2122;], the spot on which a ball landed on the roulette wheel, the displayed pips of a rolled die/dice, and the like) and a date and time stamp of exactly when the game element <b>26</b> had been read by the game element reader <b>36</b>. This data packet could then be transmitted, in real time, to the computer system <b>38</b> for processing/analyzing/storing and/or retrieving. Through the computer system <b>38</b>, this data could be transferred to/from the electronic gaming table <b>22</b> to/from a different electronic gaming table <b>22</b> or to one or more electronic table game systems <b>20</b> at one or more gaming establishments located locally or across the world.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0108">The game element reader <b>36</b> may also incorporate additional capabilities such as surface computing technology (e.g. the Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122;) to obtain/scan and/or create data from items placed proximate to the device (e.g., read smart cards, player's club card, a coupon bar-coded cards, paper or coin currency, a ticket [e.g., ticket-in/ticket-out ticket] and the like). The reader could then send this data to the computer system <b>38</b>, at which, time the computer system <b>38</b> could respond appropriately. Furthermore, surface computing technology (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122;) could be adapted to take various forms (e.g., the roulette wheel could either be partially or wholly composed of surface computing technology in order to scan the speed, direction, and/or final landing spot [and the like] of the ball and then transmit this data to the computer system <b>38</b> for processing/analyzing/storing/retrieval purposes and/or debiting/crediting players' accounts and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0109">If the game element reader <b>36</b> is further equipped with a date/time stamp <b>72</b> (e.g., a means of producing a date and time stamp of the type that is well known by those who have ordinary skill in the art), then the game element reader <b>36</b> could further transmit to the computer system <b>38</b> the date and the time (e.g., Greenwich Mean Time, also referred to as Greenwich Meridian Time) of significant events relating to activities in which the game element(s) <b>26</b> are used such as, but not be limited to, when a card is removed from the shoe (e.g., read and drawn), when a pair of dice has landed on a craps table, when a ball lands on a specific spot on a roulette wheel, and/or the like. This date and time stamp information could be used, processed/analyzed/stored and/or retrieved by the computer system <b>38</b> (e.g., the server[s]) for various purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0110">For example, if a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (and/or other bonuses, complementary items [&#x201c;comps&#x201d;] and the like) with or without a cap is provided to players of an electronic gaming table <b>22</b>, this date and time stamp data (along with other data such as, but not necessarily be limited to; the information a player has given regarding his/her specific wager; the date and time stamp of when a pair of dice has been recorded on a craps table, when a ball lands on a specific spot on a roulette wheel, the exact moment when a dealer has dealt a specific card to a player, and the like) could be crucial information for the operator of this invention <b>10</b> to verify the existence of an undisputed winner among multiple potential winning players who have achieved the predetermined winning criteria of a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot with or without a cap within the same timeframe. In such of an event, the operator of this invention <b>10</b> could access this data from the computer system <b>38</b> (e.g., the server) and, in a quick and efficient manner, determine which player obtained the predetermined winning criteria first to resolve any player disputes.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0111">As substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>, the player's electronic interface <b>30</b>, in at least one embodiment of the invention <b>10</b>, could be a touch screen <b>48</b> similar to the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. The player's electronic interface(s) <b>32</b> could be placed proximate to the playing surface <b>24</b> (e.g., be flush with the top of the playing surface <b>24</b> and located where players could normally position themselves at the gaming table). The dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could be connected to the computer system <b>38</b> to generally allow the computer system <b>38</b> to process data regarding player identification, wager information and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0112">The player's electronic interface <b>30</b>, with suitable programming of the computer system <b>38</b> could feature and display functional buttons <b>50</b>, icons <b>52</b>, and the like for the computer illiterate and/or for data entry accuracy/expediency. By pressing a button/icon <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and the like, these player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b> could give players the ability to: place wagers (e.g., bets) using electronic game play credits; place one or more wagers at once (e.g., on non-card game tables [e.g., craps, roulette and the like] the player has the ability to place a large number of bets for each round); play one or more hands at once <b>76</b>; repeat a wager without having to manually type in the amount <b>78</b>; cashout <b>74</b> (e.g., receiving a ticket-in/ticket-out ticket for a partial or full amount <b>82</b>, transferring the funds to one or more smart cards <b>80</b>, printing out a monetary reward [e.g., a &#x201c;tip&#x201d;] for the dealer, the cocktail waitress, and/or the valet attendant, and the like); obtain gaming/wagering help (which could allow the player to access information about the game [e.g., house rules, how to play/place bets, and the like]); play banker (which could allow the player to play the part of the banker [e.g., the dealer] if certain criteria has been met); place insurance (which could allow the player to purchase insurance in the case that the dealer has been dealt blackjack) <b>90</b>; make a split <b>92</b> (which could allow the player, in the game of blackjack, to split his or her cards into two or more hands providing the house rules allow it); double down a bet (which could allow the player, in blackjack, to double his or her bet in accordance with house rules); play a number of hands (which could allow the player to play multiple hands at one time at the same table); provide a tip for the dealer (which could allow the player to give the dealer a monetary reward [e.g., a &#x201c;tip&#x201d;] in the form of a ticket-in/ticket-out ticket/coupon/electronic game play credits which can then be redeemed for currency at the gaming establishment's cashier); place a bet as off <b>94</b> (which could allow a player in craps to remove a specific bet off of the playing surface <b>24</b> in accordance with house rules); monitor player's credit <b>96</b> (a credit counter, which could provide the player the visual [or audible] means of determining how many electronic game play credits he/she has in their account); bet as dealer <b>100</b> (which, in baccarat, could allow a player to bet on the dealer); bet as player <b>98</b> (which, in baccarat, could allow a player in to bet on the player); bet on tie <b>102</b> (which, in baccarat, could allow a player to bet that the dealer and the player's hand will tie).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0113">Other button options (e.g., an &#x201c;other options&#x201d; button) could allow the player to participate in non-gaming activities such as, but limited to: ordering drinks from the bar <b>106</b>; printing out a monetary reward (e.g., a &#x201c;tip&#x201d;) for the cocktail waitress in the form of a ticket/coupon/electronic game play credits <b>108</b>; placing restaurant reservations within the gaming establishment; obtain comps and incentives <b>110</b>; make hotel accommodations <b>112</b>; buy show and sporting events tickets <b>116</b>; order retrieval of the player's car from valet <b>114</b>; printing out a monetary reward (e.g., a &#x201c;tip&#x201d;) for valet in the form of a ticket/coupon/electronic game play credits; and the like. In this manner, the player may not need to leave the gaming table to conduct such non-gaming-related activities.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0114">The player's electronic interface <b>32</b> could receive data from the computer system <b>38</b> concerning, but not be limited to, gaming establishment information sent to the individual player about offers (e.g., &#x201c;teaser advertisements&#x201d;) or actual receipt of services, bonuses, comps, prizes, enticements, gratuities, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0115">Other data the player's electronic interface <b>32</b> could collect could include, but not necessarily be limited to, data about the players that the gaming establishment could collect and subsequently data mine such as: player wagering (e.g., history and patterns); gaming preferences; behavioral gaming patterns; buying patterns; and the like. In this manner, the gaming establishment could receive through the invention <b>10</b> a tremendous amount of information regarding the player (and, in a networked system situation, a vast number of players) that the computer system <b>38</b> could record and/or process into a data base that could be subsequently used by the gaming establishment or other operators to make its operations more efficient and profitable.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0116">As substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>19</b>, the invention <b>10</b> could utilize a surface-computing platform (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; or other surface-computing platforms and the like) to wherein the entire playing surface <b>24</b> could be an touch screen <b>48</b> which could then allow the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> to be part of, integral to, the playing surface <b>24</b> without having to install separate electronic interfaces as individual electronic devices for each of the individual players. Various embodiments of the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could feature, but not be limited to, such elements as: visual/audible indicators (e.g. error messages [e.g., out of order, please bet the minimum bet, and the like]; statistical data displays [e.g., how many comp points the player has been awarded by the gaming establishment and the like]; and customizable art displays/and or screensavers. Other elements may include, but not be limited to: radio frequency identification (RFID) implementations; biometric interfaces, which could offer unique identifying security measures (e.g., unique identifiers could include, but not be limited to, fingerprints, hand geometry, earlobe geometry, retina and iris patterns, voice waves, DNA, and signatures which could allow for almost instantaneous personal identification that could be used separately, as a pair, or three or more collectively); and the like. These elements could allow the player's electronic interface <b>32</b> to become very automated so that, rather than having a player manually inputting information; the player's actions/thoughts/eye motions/and the like could be automatically read by the electronic player interface and subsequently translated into an electronic format to which the computer system <b>38</b> could respond appropriately (e.g., the Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; could scan currency as it is placed on the table and, if appropriate, based on the dealer's indications, the computer system <b>38</b> could convert it into electronic game play credits and attribute those credits to the correct player's account.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0117">In at least one embodiment where the playing surface <b>24</b> could be touch screen <b>48</b> enabled through the computer system <b>30</b> with one or more surface computing platforms (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like), the playing surface <b>24</b> could be assigned into sections, wherein a section could be given functionality, such as the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. In this manner, the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>, the player's electronic interface <b>32</b>, the game element reader <b>36</b>, the player's monetary device <b>34</b>, and the like, could be built (and displayed) into the playing surface <b>24</b> itself. For example, a surface computing platform (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like) first could serve as the gaming table's actual playing surface <b>24</b> (e.g., presenting indicia and programmed for the games of craps, roulette, blackjack, and the like) while the second surface computing platform (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like) could be located on the lip of the table. The second surface computing platforms (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like) could serve as the player's electronic interface <b>32</b> as well as the player's monetary device <b>34</b>. The second surface computing platform, located on the lip of the table, could have the same functionality and options as the previously described for providing one or more player's electronic interface <b>32</b> and one or more player's monetary devices <b>34</b>. In this manner, the computer system <b>38</b> could be programmed to alter the displays of the playing surface <b>24</b> (utilizing server based technology), thus changing the type of table games (e.g., from a blackjack format to a pai gow format) that could be presented on the electronic gaming table <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0118">As substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the player's monetary device <b>34</b> could include, but should not be limited to, a bill/gaming ticket acceptor (e.g., ticket-in-ticket-out ticket); a printer (for issuing coupons, tickets, receipts, and the like), a card reader device that could accept smart cards (e.g., a smart card being a card wherein data is stored upon the card's embedded integrated circuit), player's club cards, and currency (to generally speed up the process of converting currency into an electronic format known as game play credits). The one or more player's monetary devices <b>34</b> could be installed in proximity of the player's electronic interface <b>32</b> (e.g., next to it, beneath it, and the like) relative to the table structure.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0119">The player's monetary device <b>34</b> could handle several processes including, but not be limited to, the ability to: cashout <b>74</b> with full or partial amounts; transfer funds to various medias (e.g., other smart cards, various types of tickets and coupons, and the like); print monetary reward (e.g., &#x201c;tip) tickets; printing reservation tickets and receipts; printing inner-casino commerce coupons; accepting valet tickets for the purpose of vehicle retrieval; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0120">The player's monetary device <b>34</b> could be connected to the computer system <b>38</b>, and the computer system <b>38</b> could be programmed to generally allow the player's electronic interface <b>32</b> to be able to display electronic game play credits available for the player, which could used for; wagering purposes (and the like), the electronic means for cashing out, and to provide players the ability to utilize their player's club card or smart card in the same manner as they currently do at an electronic gaming machine (e.g., they could now have the ability to insert their card and begin game play rather than insisting the dealer stop game play in order to let the pit boss insert their card at a centralized pit terminal).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0121">The invention <b>10</b>, by enabling the player with self-service activities (e.g., print coupons, comps, monetary reward (tip) tickets, valet tickets, cashout [e.g., ticket-in/ticket-out ticket or smart card], and/or transfer funds to other smart cards, etc. at will) could alleviate the dealer from doing so, thus relieving the gaming establishment of the cost of providing such manpower for such services. Furthermore, all the player's activities involving the player's monetary device <b>34</b> could be used to generate data about the player that in turn could be processed/analyzed/stored and/or retrieved by the computer system <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0122">The player's monetary devices <b>34</b> could be constructed to incorporate the capabilities of a surface computing platform (e.g., the Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like) that could scan currency as it is placed on the playing surface <b>24</b> of the table structure. Based on the dealer's commands inputted through to the computer system <b>38</b>, the invention <b>10</b> could electronically exchange this currency (with the dealer retaining the tendered currency) for electronic game play credits. The dealer's commands could cause the invention <b>10</b> to attribute those credits to the tendering player's account.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0123">The surface computing platform as incorporated into the player's monetary device <b>34</b> could also scan other items (e.g., a player's club card, a smart card, a coupon, a ticket [e.g., ticket-in/ticket-out ticket]; and the like) and send this data to the computer system <b>38</b> which in turn could react with the appropriate response to the correct player. The player's monetary device <b>34</b> could also have the elements of radio-frequency identification (RFID) capability incorporated into the player/smart card systems.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0124">A substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the invention <b>10</b> could further be comprised of a wireless gaming device <b>130</b> (e.g., hand-held) with a touch screen <b>48</b> that could support a player's electronic interface <b>32</b> that could allow one or more players to remotely participate in the wagering occurring at an electronic gaming table <b>22</b>. The wireless gaming device <b>130</b> could communicate through a wireless modem (or other electronic device[s]) connected to the computer system <b>38</b>. This capability could allow a player, somewhere in the gaming establishment (or in other areas that permit gaming according to jurisdictional gaming laws and regulations), to generally remotely observe and possibly directly engage in wagering on a player-selected electronic gaming table <b>22</b> (e.g., craps, roulette, and the like). The wireless gaming device <b>130</b> could be any suitable hand-held wireless gaming device <b>130</b> or wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) with the ability to support the player's electronic interface <b>32</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0125">The wireless gaming device <b>130</b>, through its player's electronic interface <b>32</b> could be configured with suitable computer system <b>38</b> programming to generally include a listing of all electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> throughout one or more gaming establishments with a number assigned to each gaming table. Upon looking up a specific table number, the player could sign onto (e.g., by swiping a smart card and the like) an electronic gaming table <b>22</b>. The wireless gaming device <b>130</b> with a player's electronic interface <b>32</b> could then automatically display the indicia of the chosen electronic gaming table <b>22</b> along with the player's electronic game play credits. The player could then place a wager remotely through the player's electronic interface <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0126">It is possible that the invention <b>10</b> could be configured so that the remote wagering done through the wireless gaming device <b>130</b> be conducted so as generally not to disrupt the actual game play, and the computer system <b>38</b> could be tasked to generally process the crediting and debiting of the remote players' accounts automatically. Depending on the configuration and implementation, the electronic table game (e.g., the playing surface <b>24</b> being a surface computing platform [e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like]) that the remote player is wagering upon, may or may not display these remote bets. The wagering and table game play taking place through these wireless gaming device <b>130</b><i>s </i>could be subject to normal game play and house rules (e.g., starting and stopping of wagering periods and the like). Furthermore, the wireless gaming device's (with a player's electronic interface <b>32</b>) software could be adapted so that it is in compliance with local, jurisdictional, state, and national gaming laws and regulations (e.g., a jurisdiction could possibly forbid automatic repetitive betting on hand-held, wireless electronic device with a player's electronic interface <b>32</b> and the like). The setup, programming, and components of these wireless gaming devices <b>130</b> with a player's electronic interface <b>32</b> could be determined by any person who has ordinary skill in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0138">Dealer's Electronic Interface examples</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0139">At least one possible embodiment of the invention <b>10</b> could have the dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> be used on any electronic gaming table <b>22</b> where the game element <b>26</b> is playing cards (e.g., blackjack, pai-gow, baccarat, poker, and the like), could be of any type (e.g., style, look, color, and the like) used by any electronic gaming table <b>22</b> today (and (if necessary) could be fitted (e.g., programmed, designed, and the like by those with ordinary skill in the art) to accommodate the dealer so the dealer could interact with the computer system <b>38</b> to input data while facilitating an electronic gaming table <b>22</b> where playing cards are the game element <b>26</b> without interrupting or slowing down the flow of the gaming table's play. While the possibilities of how the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could look and feel are almost endless (and by no means to be construed as limiting in any one specific design), this embodiment will attempt to describe one possible look, feel, and/or design of a dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> that could be utilized on electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> where the game element <b>26</b> could be playing cards (e.g., blackjack, pai-gow, baccarat, poker, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0140">For example, one possible illustration of what features, buttons <b>50</b>, icons <b>52</b> (and the like) a dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could have, but may not be limited to, includes one or more clusters of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an animated box-like figure containing buttons <b>50</b> and/or icons <b>52</b> illustrating the number of hands [e.g., a player could play more than one hand during the same game] each player could play at any one single point of time during a round of play and the like); a number display for each player indicating that player's location (or position <b>40</b>) on the electronic gaming table <b>22</b>, which could be limitless depending on the design of the electronic gaming table <b>22</b>; and possible hand combinations (e.g., if a player splits a hand or decides to play more than one hand, this information could be displayed on the dealer's interface).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0141">These buttons <b>50</b>/and or icons <b>52</b> could also be used to indicate to which player the playing cards were dealt: one of these clusters of buttons <b>50</b> could be operated by first pressing one of these buttons <b>50</b> (or icons <b>52</b>) (e.g., player 1, hand 1&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) before removing a card from the shoe and then dealing it to that specific player for one or more specific hand(s). This action (along with the data collected from the electronic shoe [e.g., the Shufflemaster&#xae; iShoe&#x2122; and the like] as the playing cards are removed and dealt) could allow the computer system <b>38</b> to record which player(s) have been dealt a specific card. A &#x201c;dealer's hand&#x201d; button <b>55</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) could be used to assist the dealer with recording information to tell the computer system <b>38</b> that the next card to be removed from the electronic shoe (e.g., the Shufflemaster&#xae; iShoe&#x2122; and the like) will go to the dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0142">The dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could have a &#x201c;dealer reveal&#x201d; button <b>55</b> (e.g., an icon and the like), which could allow the dealer to send the computer system <b>38</b> two important pieces of information: first, that the player(s) at the electronic gaming table <b>22</b> have completed their hand(s) and two, that the dealer is now ready to reveal his face down card to complete the round of the hand. The &#x201c;dealer reveal&#x201d; button <b>54</b> could prevent the computer system <b>38</b> from prematurely crediting or debiting the player(s) accounts before the hand is over. Once the dealer has pressed the &#x201c;dealer reveal&#x201d; button <b>54</b> (e.g., the icon and the like), the dealer could then reveal his/her face down card. If, after the dealer has revealed his/her face down card, the dealer needs one or more cards to complete the round of game play, the dealer could use the &#x201c;dealer's hand&#x201d; button <b>55</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) to (once again) indicate to the computer system <b>38</b> that the next card to be removed from the electronic shoe (e.g., the Shufflemaster&#xae; iShoe&#x2122; and the like) will go to the dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0143">The cluster of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) to designate a player's position could be arranged along the top half and/or the middle of the screen. These buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) could be large enough in both size and font to make finding and pressing/touching them easy and efficient for the dealer. The location of the remaining buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like), (e.g., &#x201c;dealer hand,&#x201d; &#x201c;dealer reveal,&#x201d; and other possible buttons <b>50</b> [e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like] as needed) could all be placed some where beneath (and/or in proximity to) the cluster of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0144">For example, in the embodiment designed for the play and wagering of blackjack, two more buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) could be added to the host of other buttons <b>50</b>, icons <b>52</b>, and the like to allow the dealer the unique ability to inform the computer system <b>38</b> if and when the dealer has been dealt a blackjack with an ace being the face up card. These two buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) could be titled &#x201c;blackjack&#x201d; <b>60</b> and/or &#x201c;No blackjack&#x201d; <b>62</b>. These two buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) could be used by the dealer to inform the computer system <b>38</b> that, after an ace has been dealt face up for the dealer and after the players have been given the opportunity to purchase table &#x201c;insurance,&#x201d; the dealer could use these two buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) to inform the electronic gaming table <b>22</b> that the dealer has (or has not) been dealt a blackjack (e.g., two playing cards with the total value being no more, or less than 21). The location of the &#x201c;blackjack&#x201d; and &#x201c;no blackjack&#x201d; buttons <b>50</b> [e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like]) could all be placed somewhere beneath (and/or in proximity to) the cluster of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. &#x201c;Dealer Reveal&#x201d; <b>54</b>, &#x201c;Blackjack&#x201d; <b>60</b>, and &#x201c;No Blackjack&#x201d; <b>62</b> selections can be seen as means to mitigate the final steps to end the hand although the computer system <b>38</b> already knows what cards the player(s) and dealer are respectively holding (e.g., the computer system <b>38</b> has sufficient information to process the wagers for the round of play).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0145">In another embodiment, the dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> that could also be effectively used on any electronic gaming table <b>22</b> where the game element <b>26</b> may not be playing cards, for example, a pair of dice or a ball (e.g., craps, roulette and the like). These dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> could be of any; type, style, look, feel and color, and could be fitted (e.g., programmed, designed, and the like in a manner known by those with ordinary skill in the art) to accommodate the dealer so the dealer could interact with the computer system <b>38</b> to input data while facilitating an electronic gaming table <b>22</b> where other types of game elements <b>26</b> could be used (e.g., a pair of dice for the game of craps, a ball for the game of roulette, and the like) without interrupting or slowing down the flow of the gaming table's play. While the possibilities of how the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could look and feel are almost endless (and by no means to be construed as limiting in any one specific design), this embodiment will attempt to describe one possible look, feel, and/or design of a dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> that could be utilized on non-playing card electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> where the game element <b>26</b> could be a pair of dice for the game of craps, a ball for the game of roulette, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0146">One such example (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) of what the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> for non-card table game could feature buttons <b>50</b>, icons <b>52</b> (and the like) could have, but may not be limited to, includes one or more clusters of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an animated box-like figure containing buttons <b>50</b> and/or icons <b>52</b> illustrating a listing of all of the numbers that may be obtained utilizing the one or more game elements <b>26</b> (e.g., a pair of dice, a ball, and the like). These numbers could be listed in numerical order. One possible means of utilizing the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> for the game of craps, roulette, and the like could include pressing one of these buttons <b>50</b> after the results of a pair of dice being thrown, the number associated with the final resting spot of a ball on a roulette wheel, and the like. This action could allow the computer system <b>38</b> to record the results of when a pair of dice has been thrown in a game of craps, a ball landing on a roulette wheel, and the like. Two &#x201c;wager lock out&#x201d; buttons <b>56</b> (e.g., an icon and the like): &#x201c;On&#x201d; and &#x201c;Off.&#x201d; These two buttons <b>50</b> could be used to assist the dealer in effectively facilitating when players could and could not place bets (e.g., wagers). By pressing one of these two buttons <b>50</b>, the computer system <b>38</b> could send one of two messages to all players on their one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> and/or hand held wireless gaming devices <b>130</b>. The first message or command (which is sent to the computer system <b>38</b> when the dealer presses the &#x201c;On&#x201d; button/icon) could be that bets (e.g., wagers) may now be allowed and encouraged; the second message (which is sent when the dealer presses the &#x201c;Off&#x201d; button/icon) could be that bets (e.g., wagers) are temporarily suspended. This &#x201c;Off&#x201d; button could prevent the system from accepting wagers from players after the dealer and the players have seen the results of game play and before a dealer could react by recording the results of game play.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0147">Other options for buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) could include &#x201c;Pit Boss&#x201d; button <b>68</b> which, when pressed, could send a signal to the pit boss in order to inform him or her that the dealer needs assistance. The cluster of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) listing of all of the numbers that may be obtained utilizing the one or more game elements (e.g., a pair of dice, a ball, and the like) could be arranged in the middle of the screen. These buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) could be large enough in both size and font to make finding and pressing/touching them easy and efficient for the dealer. The location of the remaining buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) (e.g., &#x201c;On&#x201d; or &#x201c;Off [for the wager lockout],&#x201d; &#x201c;Pit Boss,&#x201d; and other possible buttons <b>50</b> [e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like] as needed) could all be placed somewhere beneath (and/or in proximity to) the cluster of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0148">The craps embodiment for the dealer's electronic interface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) could five more buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) could be added to the host of other buttons <b>50</b>, icons <b>52</b> and the like, to allow the dealer to inform the computer system <b>38</b> (through the point number button <b>58</b>) what the point number is for the round of play (e.g., the first number the shooter has rolled at the start of the game. This would be the number the shooter will try to roll again). In order for the dealer to indicate to the computer system <b>38</b> what the point number will be for the round of game play, the dealer would press/touch the &#x201c;point number&#x201d; button <b>58</b> on his or her dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> prior to pressing/touching the numbered button/icon <b>64</b> associated with that number.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0149">For example, if the shooter has rolled the number 4 for his point number, the dealer would press/touch the &#x201c;point number&#x201d; button/icon <b>58</b> and then press/touch the number four button/icon <b>64</b>. This action would then send the point number data to the computer system <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0150">Another option of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) that could be unique to the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> on a crap table could be buttons <b>50</b> and/or icons <b>52</b> representing all of the &#x201c;hard ways <b>68</b> (e.g., two 2's, two 3's, two 4&#x2032; and two 5's).&#x201d; These four buttons <b>68</b> (e.g., an icon and the like) could be used by the dealer to inform the computer system <b>38</b> that a pair of dice with the same number on each (e.g., two 2's, two 3's, two 4' and two 5's) have been rolled. These specific buttons <b>50</b>/icons <b>52</b> could allow the computer system <b>38</b> to record, credit and/or debit those players who have bet (e.g., wagered) on a combination of dice that can only be rolled one way. The location of the &#x201c;point number&#x201d; button <b>58</b> and the hard way numbers buttons <b>66</b> (could all be placed somewhere beneath (and/or in proximity to) the cluster of buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0151">The location of these dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b><i>s </i>on any electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> that employs playing cards as its game element <b>26</b> could be located proximate where the chip tray (the tray that is used to hold casino chips) is currently located. This possible location of the dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> could make it easier for the dealer to interact with the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. The dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> that could be utilized on all electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> (e.g., blackjack, craps, roulette, pai-gow, baccarat, poker, and the like) could be of any type (e.g., style, look, color, and the like) and could be adapted to allow a player to wager on any possible combination of wagers allowed by the gaming establishment, and, if necessary, could be fitted (e.g., programmed, designed, configured, and the like) to accommodate (e.g., display) the indicia of any non-card gaming table (e.g., craps, roulette, and the like). The programming of these player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b> could be adapted or changed based on the requirements of the particular embodiment of the invention <b>10</b>. These player's electronic interfaces generally allow players to interact with the computer system <b>38</b> by processing, recording data concerning: wagering, options, cashing out options, other possible non-gaming options (e.g., making restaurant reservations, purchasing show tickets, making a room reservation, retrieving a vehicle from valet, printing out tip tickets, ordering drinks from the bar, and the like) while allowing a player to enjoy the gaming table's live action without interrupting or slowing down the flow of the gaming table's action. Other functions of the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could include, but not be limited to; receiving data from the dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> (e.g., when players may or may not be allowed to place a wager, game play results, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0152">The dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> could easily be designed, programmed, configured, and/or installed by those with ordinary skill in the art to allow any and all selections (e.g., data entries) made by any player to be electronically processed/analyzed/stored and/or retrieved by the computer system <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0153">Progressive Bonus Jackpot</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0154">As substantially show in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the invention <b>10</b> could provide table games played on dealer run electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> with a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot. This formulation of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot with an electronic table game <b>22</b> is substantially made possible due to the fact that this invention <b>10</b> provides the various means to: identify the player (e.g., through the player's one or more monetary devices, and the like); identify the amount of electronic game play credits that a player has wagered through the one or more player's electronic interface <b>32</b><i>s</i>; and verify that the predetermined winning criteria has been met using data which has been transmitted from the one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> (which has been entered by a human dealer) or the combination of the game element reader <b>36</b> and the one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> (which has been entered by a human dealer). This single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot feature could be installed either on one electronic gaming table <b>22</b>, on multiple electric gaming tables <b>22</b> within the same gaming establishment, or across many different locations (e.g., either in one country or across multiple countries in accordance with jurisdictional and international laws and regulations).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0155">The programming needed to establish the installation of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot feature with the electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> can be accomplished by those with ordinary skill in the art. The configuration and programming of the computer system <b>38</b> for providing the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot feature could be generally analogous in nature to those progressive computer system <b>38</b><i>s </i>that are currently offered through electronic gaming machines, electronic lottery machines, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0156">The single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot element of the invention <b>10</b> generally does not require any type of &#x201c;side bet&#x201d; to be eligible to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot. In one embodiment of the invention <b>10</b>, for a player to be eligible to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, all that a player could be required to do is simply place the minimum required bet (or more) needed to play at the electronic gaming table <b>22</b>. Once that bet is made, the player is automatically eligible to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot. Other embodiments could require that the player to first sign up for the gaming establishment's players' club card program and/or smart card program.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0157">To win the invention <b>10</b>'s single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, the player generally must meet a predetermined winning criterion. In the case of card games, a player may be required to win a wager with a predetermined set of cards. In one embodiment, the player wins the wager over this set of cards being dealt to the dealer. The set of cards may also be required to be in a specific order; in one or more hands; be dealt within a specific timeframe; and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0158">In the case of non-card games, a player (e.g., in a craps or roulette game) may be required to roll/land game element(s) <b>26</b> (e.g. a pair of dice or a ball) on a specific number or set of numbers. This/these number/numbers may be further required to be garnered in a specific order (e.g., if more than one number is to be acquired); in one or more rounds of game play; within a specific timeframe; and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0159">To fund the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (and/or for the payout of other comps, bonuses, etc.), the computer system <b>38</b> could be programmed to automatically deduct a percentage of all the monies wagered by the players on either all or some of the establishment's electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> of the invention <b>10</b>. In another embodiment of the invention <b>10</b>, a percentage of the winnings of the electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> located within a gaming establishment could be used to fund the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (and/or for the payout of other comps, bonuses, etc).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0160">Other embodiments of this invention <b>10</b> could have several different versions of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot system: it could be limited to a single or multiple states, a single or multiple military installations, a single or multiple offshore gaming establishments (e.g., cruise lines, river boats, and the like), single or multiple country/countries; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0161">One possible embodiment of the invention <b>10</b> could feature a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, with or without a cap could further have one or more communication means <b>180</b> could be networked within the computer system <b>38</b>. This communication means <b>180</b>, in one version, could be visually based, such as a large electronic sign or display <b>182</b> (e.g., a vacuum florescent display (VFD), liquid crystal display (LCD), or any other comparable display device) having a real-time counter display. The communication means <b>180</b> could be generally installed in proximity to one or more electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> (e.g., electronic gaming table <b>22</b> playing area or other areas as desired by the gaming establishment) for the purpose of creating playing interest and to educate the public (e.g., players and potential players) that a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap) has been introduced to the electronic gaming tables <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0162">More specifically this means of communication could be used to communicate and publicly advertise information such as: the current jackpot amount of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap); the current winning criteria (e.g., any requirement) to be achieved by the dealer, the player, and/or both (at the same time) for the player to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot during normal game play; whether or not a cap has been introduced to the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot; the current winning criteria for the player(s) during the 100 million dollar cap playoff; the amount needed to reach the 100 million dollar cap; the projected/estimated time until the 100 million dollar cap could be reached; the estimated date and time of when the odds for the 100 million cap may be changed in favor of the player; the names and faces of previous winners of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap); and any advertising campaigns that could be associated with the gaming establishment (e.g., special comps, 2 for 1 show tickets, restaurants specials, special room rates, upcoming sporting/special events, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0163">In addition to the visual communication means <b>180</b> such as signage, the gaming establishment may install audible alarms, flashing lights, balloon release mechanisms, and the like which is networked to the computer system <b>38</b> in order to draw more attention to single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot-related events, award winners, and other celebratory occasions concerning the operation of the invention <b>10</b> and such.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0164">The single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot embodiment of the invention <b>10</b> could further offer a predetermined cap (and the like), the cap generally being a predetermined limit as to the amount that the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could reach. The purpose of the cap feature could be threefold: first, it could limit the amount of funds awarded to a winning player or pool of players; two, it could provide the operator with the funds collected by the surplus account (after the cap is reached); to possibly fund the next single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot; and three, it could allow the operator to possibly electronically alter the odds of winning (in favor of the player) the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (in accordance with jurisdictional laws and regulations) (e.g., lowering the payback odds from 40 to 1 to 7 to 1) in such a way as to favor the players more so than the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot without the cap. This cap embodiment of the invention <b>10</b> could then award the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot sooner rather than later, which in turn could increase the game play urgency, player participation, and player excitement for the invention <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0165">In operation, the implementation of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could require that the computer system <b>38</b> be programmed or otherwise modified to credit a small percentage of each wager placed by a table game player (also, as noted above, the operator of the invention <b>10</b> could limit the participation in the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot [with or without a cap] to select table game players [e.g., such as those players participating in a gaming establishment's players' club]) into a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout account. The sole purpose for the separate account is generally the funding of the payout of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap). Alternative embodiments could have the funding of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout account for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap) be provided by taking a portion of the gaming establishment's winnings or a combination of a small percentage of the players' placed wager(s) and the game establishment's winnings, and the like. The funds accumulated in the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout account could be awarded to the winning player or a plurality of players in the form of an annuity or a reduced lump sum (whichever the winning player/players choose).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0166">This funding of the progressive bonus jackpot payout account could continue until the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap) has been won; then, the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout account could be used to provide the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout. The single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout account could be emptied and otherwise reset (e.g., reseeded) with a base jackpot amount (e.g., 7 million dollars) to once again receive funding for a new single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0167">The operation of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could comprise of a cycle mode (e.g., sequence of events). The operation of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot with a cap feature could be comprised of two different cycle modes the &#x201c;regular winning cycle mode&#x201d; and a &#x201c;cap winning cycle mode.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0168">The regular winning cycle mode could begin when a predetermined winning criteria has been established on an electronic gaming table <b>22</b>, the jackpot has been otherwise seeded, the table game play and wagering commenced with a small percentage of each wager could be earmarked (or any other similar monetary pooling method could be implemented) for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout account. This &#x201c;regular winning cycle mode&#x201d; could reset (e.g., start with a new, reseeded jackpot) when the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has been awarded. If the operator decides to implement a cap (e.g., the maximum allowable amount that the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot can reach [e.g., 100 million dollars]), then a &#x201c;cap winning cycle mode,&#x201d; with its own two distinct phases, could be introduced to the computer system <b>38</b>. The first phase of this cap winning cycle mode, which could last for a brief time period (e.g., 24 hours), could be seen as a temporary supplement to the regular winning cycle mode. The second phase of the cap winning cycle mode could end when a player or a plurality of players wins the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot with the cap in place.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0169">Once the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot reaches the pre-determined cap amount, the system could automatically switch to the first phase of the &#x201c;cap winning cycle mode.&#x201d; In this first phase of the &#x201c;cap winning cycle mode,&#x201d; the funds being collected for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could be diverted into a surplus account (thereby making the level of funds in the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot's payout account static at the cap amount). During the end of the &#x201c;regular winning cycle mode&#x201d; and throughout both phases of the &#x201c;cap winning cycle mode,&#x201d; the gaming establishments could engage in various types of marketing campaigns in order to generate awareness, to engender a &#x201c;party-like atmosphere, and to bring in more potential players. In the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode, the regular winning cycle mode could officially terminate, and the odds of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot with a cap could be progressively reduced in phases in ever-greater favor of the players (in order to create more excitement and interest in the game).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0170">Winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot during the regular winning cycle mode, depending on the type of table game being played through the computer system <b>38</b> (e.g., the play action generated at the table game would have to be such that the odds of achieving the predetermined winning criteria could greatly favor the gaming establishment rather than the player) could be predicated upon one or more non-timed predetermined winning criteria or one or more timed predetermined winning criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0171">The funds accumulated in the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout account could be awarded to a winning player or a winning plurality of players in the form of an annuity or a reduced lump sum (whichever the player/players choose).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0172">The ways of winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot with a non-timed predetermined winning criteria (with or without a cap) could be prescribed based upon the number of game elements <b>26</b> (e.g., cards, ball, dice and the like) attributed to a gaming table multiplied by these elements' implementations (e.g., a single deck of cards could offer a variety of predetermined winning criteria: two, three, or four [or more] specific cards for the player with the possibility of the dealer having to have the same type of cards dealt to him or her; two, three, or four [or more] specific cards in a particular order; a certain hand for the player, the dealer and/or both; and the like). This feature could also be applied to non-playing card electronic gaming tables <b>22</b>: for example, in craps, the player would have to roll three specific dice combinations in a row (e.g., a hard four, a hard six, and a hard eight in that order); in roulette, the ball would have to land on three specific numbers in three continuous games (e.g., a player could bet and win the ball landing on <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> in that order.) As shown in these examples, the operator could choose numerous variations of predetermine winning criterion. The resultant odds (e.g., those based on the number of game elements <b>26</b> multiplied by the elements' implementation for use in the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot [with or without a cap]) would have to be high enough in the house's favor to make them suitable for use in the gaming establishment.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0173">The timed predetermined winning criteria could be applied to (but not limited to) those gaming tables whose game elements <b>26</b> have a much more limited range of wagering events with a corresponding limited range of odds (e.g., because of the limited number of game elements <b>26</b> and implementation of those game elements <b>26</b> into a predetermined winning criteria, the odds of winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot are lessened). These games could be, but not be limited to, non-card games such as roulette and craps (e.g., roulette having only 37 or 38 slots [the European version (single zero) has 37; the American version (single zero and double zero) has 38]) with 14 possible betting combinations thus providing a very limited number of wagering events while craps relies upon a pair of six-sided dice that can provide only 36 different numerical combinations on a table that provides only approximately 100 different possible bets).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0174">In one embodiment, the timed predetermined winning criteria for an electronic gaming table <b>22</b> (e.g., craps) that requires a die or a pair of die (e.g., dice) as the game element <b>26</b>, could require a player, or a plurality of players, at one or more electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> to wager on, and win on snake eyes no less than 3 separate times in a winning time period (e.g., one hour). This methodology for a timed predetermined winning criterion could then also be applied to electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> requiring playing cards as its game elements <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0175">For example, the timed predetermined winning criteria for gaming tables requiring playing cards (e.g., blackjack, pai-gow, baccarat and the like) could be a plurality of players, at one or more electronic gaming tables <b>22</b>, gaming establishments and the like being dealt two (or more) specific playing cards along with the possibility of the dealer also being dealt two (or more) specific cards three separate times in a winning time period (e.g., one hour). As so demonstrated, the operator could choose numerous variations of predetermine winning criterion.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0176">The timed predetermined winning criteria could have two parts: first an initiation predetermined winning wager made by one or more players that could activate one or more electronic timing devices (e.g., a countdown) that could be visible (or heard or both) in proximity of the electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> for the purpose of counting down a winning time period. Second, placing one or more payout predetermined winning wagers before the lapse of the winning time period.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0177">In a timed predetermined winning criteria situation, the initiation predetermined winning wager (could be any suitable predetermined winning criteria made by one or more players) upon its occurrence, could cause the computer system <b>38</b> through various communication means <b>180</b> connected to it: 1) to broadcast various information (e.g., what additional winning criterion [in addition to what has already been acquired] is needed to be obtained by one or more players to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot [with or without a cap] and the like) to one or more players and/or one or more potential players through various communication means <b>180</b> connected to the computer system <b>38</b>; <b>2</b>) to open a data pool supported by the electronic gaming system to collect player or player position <b>40</b> identification information for the player(s) who have made initiation and/or a plurality of payout predetermined winning wagers during this regular winning cycle mode; and 3) to start a countdown timer that, if applicable, will run for a predetermined period of time (e.g., a half-hour, an hour, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0178">To win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap), one or more players must wager, through the computer system <b>38</b> for that particular gaming table format, the initiation predetermined winning wager and/or a plurality of payout predetermined winning wagers prior to the timer counting down (if a timer is applicable, the timer may or may not only apply to the plurality of payout predetermined winning wagers).</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0179">If, after an initiation predetermined winning wager has been achieved, and if a plurality of predetermined winning wagers is made prior to the timer countdown ending (if a countdown is applicable), then the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap) could be paid out (e.g., from the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot account&#x2014;either to a solitary winning player or, in equal shares, to multiple winning players. Regardless of the gaming table or the gaming establishment wherein the gaming table is located in, one player may win or multiple players may win, depending upon the structure of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot's (with or without a cap) winning criteria] to a player or a plurality of players who made the initiation and/or the following predetermined winning wagers,</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0180">The correct jackpot payout could be determined by the computer system <b>38</b> utilizing player and player position data garnered (via the token ring) from one or more player's electronic interfaces (and if otherwise required, from data inputted through one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b>). Once the jackpot payout occurs, the computer system <b>38</b> could cause the countdown timer, if applicable, to reset (e.g., be inactivated). The computer system <b>38</b> could then cause the broadcast of information about the payout/winning of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot. After this broadcast, the system could shut down the broadcast means and the, accredit the winning player(s) with the winning amount (or equal shares of the winning amount if there is a plurality of winning players) from the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout account. The payout(s) could be made to the accounts of the winning player's/winning players' through the one or more player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0181">The system could then reset the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot account to collect for the new single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap), clear data from the winning pool (e.g., deleting and/or archiving the winning player(s) ID(s) and the player(s) position data). The computer system <b>38</b> could then reset to await the occurrence of the next initiation predetermined winning wager for the next single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0182">If the occurrence of all the timed predetermined winning criteria wagers does not occur before the countdown timer (if a timer is applicable) finishes its countdown, then the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap) may not be awarded to any player/players computer system <b>38</b>. In such an instance, then the computer system <b>38</b> could cause the countdown timer (if a timer is applicable) to reset (e.g., be inactivated), communicate information (e.g., a short announcement or broadcast through visual and/or auditory means) regarding the ending of the regular winning cycle mode, and clear the winning pool (e.g., deleting the data [e.g., player Ids and player position data] of those player(s) that have been entered into a pool of those individuals who have placed and won one or more predetermined winning criteria wagers [this data could be archived]). The computer system <b>38</b> could then continue on with the regular winning cycle mode to await the occurrence of the next initiation predetermined winning wager(s).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0183">Cap Embodiment of the Progressive Bonus Jackpot.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0184">As stated in previous embodiments, if the operator decides to implement a cap (e.g., a predetermined maximum allowable jackpot payout amount [e.g., a 100 million dollars]) with the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, this cap could be used to ensure profitability for the operator in that any monies received after the cap is reached would go under the control of the operator and would not be given back as payout under the winning of the capped single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot. If the cap is placed on the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, then a two-phase cap winning cycle mode could be introduced to supplement the regular winning cycle mode. The two-phase cap winning cycle mode which, when introduced, could end the regular winning cycle mode when a predetermined cap to the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has been reached. This two-phase cap winning cycle mode could be applied to all formats of electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> regardless of the format's choice of game element <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0185">As stated above, the two-phase cap winning cycle mode could be initiated (e.g., by the system) once the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout has reached a certain level, amount, or cap with the possibility that the cap could conclude, at any time (e.g., the ending of a set time period to any time at the operator's discretion), or terminate with one or more players winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot. This two-phase cap winning cycle mode could be comprised of: a first (e.g., initiating) phase and a second phase. The first phase could be initiated by the computer system <b>38</b> determining that the appropriate amount of funds (that have accumulated for the payout of the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout) has reached a predetermined amount or &#x201c;cap&#x201d; (e.g., $100 million dollars). When the first phase is initiated, the computer system <b>38</b> could perform a series of functions (e.g., actions or tasks) in a specific amount of time (e.g., 24 hours) before engaging the second phase.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0186">The system could engage the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode after determining that the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has not been awarded and/or after a specific set of tasks have not been performed (or achieved) by the first phase. The second phase of the cap winning cycle mode could end when the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot is finally awarded to a game table player or a plurality of game table players. After the jackpot is awarded, the electronic gaming system could under take several tasks such as seeding the next single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (e.g., 7 million dollars), clearing/archiving the data from the winning pool, and proceeding from the cap wining cycle mode back to the regular winning cycle mode.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0187">Some of the functions (e.g., actions or tasks) undertaken by the electronic gaming system in the cap winning cycle mode in its first phase could be, but not be limited to, to hold or freeze the amount of single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout at its cap level and subsequently divert during the cap winning cycle mode any and all additional incoming funds from electronic table game wagering into a temporary surplus account.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0188">The funds accumulated in the temporary surplus account could be used for various purposes by the operator of the invention <b>10</b> (as deemed appropriate or necessary and/or allowed by law in the gaming jurisdiction in which the gaming establishment is located). One such possible purpose could be to use all or part of the accumulated surplus funds to &#x201c;seed&#x201d; (e.g., begin) the next single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap). Another purpose for the surplus account could be to fund comps, bonuses, rewards, or other activities as deemed appropriate or necessary by the operator of the invention <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0189">Another function (e.g., actions or tasks) that could immediately be set in motion upon the activation of the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode could be, to activate a cap countdown timer (e.g., counting down a predetermined fixed period of time, if a countdown timer is employed). The countdown timer could be used to determine if and when the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode could be initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0190">In addition, another function (e.g., actions or tasks) that could be placed in motion by the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode could include all means of communication that might be introduced throughout the gaming establishment (e.g., visual, audible, and other medias) regarding the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot and its metamorphosis toward the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0191">After the computer system <b>38</b> has determined that all of the functions (e.g., actions or tasks) of the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode have been exhausted and the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has not been awarded, the system could proceed to the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0192">Some of the functions (e.g., actions or tasks) that a cap winning cycle mode could introduce in its second phase could be, but not be limited to, broadcasting communication gaming establishment wide through a wide variety of means(s) (e.g., visually, audibly, and via other medias) to players and potential players that the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot will now enter the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode wherein the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could now become increasingly (e.g., progressively) easier to win.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0193">Another feature of the second phase function winning cycle mode could be to allow the operator (through the electronic gaming system) to increasingly (e.g., progressively) make it easier for the players (or potential players) to meet the predetermined winning criteria through either a timed or non-timed mode if the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has not been awarded during the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode. This option could be set so that the odds of winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could increasingly favor the players over a period time (e.g., in increments of weeks, months, a year, and the like). This option could be exercised by a variety of means such as progressively reducing, over a period or periods of time, the number of predetermined winning wagers needed to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (e.g., going from needing ten types of predetermined winning wagers to four types of predetermined winning wagers and the like); changing the number of predetermined winning wagers needed to win from low probability (e.g., a low chance of winning/highest odds against the player) to medium probability (e.g., a medium chance of winning/50/50 odds); or other means and various combinations of such means. Another function (e.g., actions or tasks) of the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode could be to motivate the gaming establishment to bring additional electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> online (e.g., made operative in the gaming establishment to handle the surge in anticipated game play activity). As the first phase cap countdown draws down to its end, thereby signaling the end of the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode and the beginning of the second phase, the gaming establishment could temporarily suspend gaming activity (both play activities and wagering activities) on the computer system <b>38</b> in order to allow a recitation of a &#x201c;countdown&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;TEN!, NINE!, EIGHT!, etc.&#x201d;) by the players and potential players in proximity to the electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> in order to generally add more anticipatory excitement (e.g., a party like atmosphere) to the gaming environment. This player countdown could also be simultaneously visually displayed/audibly announced through networked communication means <b>180</b> in the gaming establishment in so that the precise moment of switching from the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode to the second phase could be recorded in the computer system <b>38</b> with a system-endorsed, computerized date/time stamp.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0194">If the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot is not won prior to the suspension of the gaming activity and after completion of the &#x201c;countdown,&#x201d; the cap winning cycle mode could then proceed to the second phase. After the cap winning cycle mode has entered into the second phase, it may remain in this mode until the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has been awarded. During this phase, if the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot is not awarded in a reasonable amount of time, the operator could have the option of making the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot progressively easier to win. Throughout this cycle it is possible by those with ordinary skill in the art to broadcast communication through a wide variety of means(s) to players and potential players (e.g., visually, audibly, and via other medias) regarding any updates regarding the predetermined winning criteria: when this predetermined winning criterion may change and any other details associated with it.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0195">Once a player, or a plurality of players, has obtained the predetermined winning criteria to be awarded the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot and the winning criteria's authenticity and the player's identity has been verified (by the operator, the system, and any other gaming or legal personnel deemed necessary), the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot account (e.g., jackpot amount) could be reset (e.g., reseeded) with a base jackpot (e.g., 7 million dollars) and the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode could then be terminated and return to the regular winning cycle mode for the purpose of, once again, receiving the funding for a new single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0196">There could be circumstances in which the progression to the second stage of the cap winning cycle mode could be delayed: For example, in the event that an electronic gaming table <b>22</b> system's (e.g., an electronic craps gaming table system) single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has reached its cap and is operating in the last remaining minutes of the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode, it is possible that a player, or a plurality of players could engage an electronic gaming table <b>22</b> on the same electronic table game system <b>20</b> in a timed predetermined winning cycle moments before the start of the cap winning cycle's second phase. This of course could prevent the second phase of the cap winning cycle on the electronic table game system <b>20</b> from starting at its predetermined, designated date/time. If this event were to take place, the second phase of the cap winning cycle could be temporarily suspended (e.g., placed on hold for a short amount of time) until the timed predetermined winning cycle has completed its normal function (e.g., actions or tasks).</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0197">If, during this timed predetermined winning cycle, the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot is awarded, the jackpot could be seeded with a base jackpot (e.g., 7 million dollars), the data on the winning player or players could be cleared, and the cap wining cycle mode could return to the regular winning cycle mode. In the event the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot is not awarded during the timed predetermined winning cycle, the computer system <b>38</b> could automatically advance into the second phase of the cap winning cycle (e.g., the second stage). As noted above, in at least one embodiment of the invention <b>10</b> could provide for having the electronic gaming system with the feature whereby progressive change(s) are made (automatically or manually) to increase the odds of winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot during the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode. The automatic progressive changing of changing the predetermined winning criteria could be implemented by the computer system <b>38</b> using means known to those with ordinary skill in the art of gaming and/or a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot and the like. The effect of dramatically increasing the odds of winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot in the player's favor could have a corresponding increase in excitement (e.g., a highly charged, party-like atmosphere) and enjoyment of playing for the players along with any potential players and add to the overall atmosphere of the play action and wagering within the invention <b>10</b>. Each change in the predetermined winning criteria that is implemented could be accompanied by communications by the invention <b>10</b> (or the gaming establishment) to the player and potential players, through various forms of networked communication means <b>180</b> (e.g., audible, visual and via other medias) of such changes and their effects throughout the gaming establishment.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0198">In at least one embodiment (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A</figref>, <b>23</b>B), this methodology of a progressive bonus jackpot with a cap could also be applied to electronic gaming machines (e.g., EGM) <b>600</b> using the knowledge of those by those with ordinary skill in the art so the invention <b>10</b> with or without a human dealer (e.g., incorporating an automated dealer on an electronic gaming machine for example, a dealer less, fully automated blackjack game machine). As such the steps normally take in the below process could be fully automated (in that the computer system <b>38</b> could b adapted to create game play rather than interpret data inputted on real world game action) so that the presentation of a electronic dealer would have those actions and steps that are generally and fundamentally indistinguishable from those taken by a human dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0199">Methodology</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0200">The process or methodology <b>500</b> of operating the invention <b>10</b> with a progressive bonus jackpot with a cap could commence with step <b>502</b>: Activation of System. In this step <b>502</b> could commence with the initiation of the computer system <b>38</b> as well as other customary gaming system start up procedures, the table(s) and all of its components could be energized (e.g., the invention is turned on). This step <b>502</b> could include, but may not be limited to, the powering of all required and related equipment needed to implement and operate the computer system <b>38</b> and all of its related electronic computer accessories (e.g., the tables, the terminals [e.g., the pit boss' terminal], electronic playing card shufflers, any hardware related to the computer system <b>38</b>, the interfaces [player and/or dealer], the player's monetary devices <b>34</b>, wireless handheld gaming device chargers/battery chargers, the shoe [e.g., the iShoe&#x2122;], any surface computers, all possible electronic signage or other electronic displays, any audible devices, and the like). During this start up, the computer system <b>38</b> could cause the one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b>, the one or more player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b>, and all electronic signage to show appropriate initial startup presentations (e.g., welcome screens, gaming displays, wagering menus, selections, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0201">In the progressive bonus jackpot embodiment, process <b>500</b> could have two different progressive bonus jackpot cycle modes (e.g., sequences of events): a &#x201c;regular winning cycle mode&#x201d; and (if a cap is introduced) a &#x201c;cap winning cycle mode&#x201d;. The regular winning cycle mode could begin at system startup, the jackpot could be seeded, the game could begin, and a small percentage of each wager could be earmarked (or any other similar monetary pooling method could be implemented) for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0202">The jackpot could be seeded with a predetermined amount of money (e.g., 7 million dollars) to create immediate interest in the invention <b>10</b>. As stated in above, the funding for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (and/or for the payout of other comps, bonuses, etc.) could be accomplished without the need of an additional bet (e.g., side bet) by the players. The wide area progressive could be programmed to automatically deduct a percentage of all the monies wagered by the players on either all or some of the establishment's electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> (e.g., this invention <b>10</b>). In another iteration, the funding for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could be provided by a percentage of the winnings from the electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> located within a gaming establishment.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0203">After step <b>502</b> has been substantially completed, the process <b>500</b> could generally proceed to step <b>504</b>, game preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0204">In step <b>502</b>, game preparation, the dealer could next initiate those gaming steps needed to prepare the playing surface <b>24</b> for game play. These steps, could include, but may not be limited to, obtaining and preparing playing cards (e.g., shuffling) through use of an electronic shuffler or manually (e.g., by hand), obtaining and placing sets of dice in a tray, obtaining and placing a roulette ball on the roulette table, and the like. After step <b>502</b> has been substantially completed, the process <b>500</b> could generally proceed to step <b>506</b>, dealer/pit boss/player log in.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0205">In step <b>506</b>, dealer/pit boss/player log in, the dealer could log into the electronic gaming table through the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> through a wide variety of security means. These means could include, but not be limited to, dealer security or lockout menu(s) (not shown) for the one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b>. Such security measures could include, but not be limited to, keypad entry (e.g., entering a password) and other unique identifying security devices (e.g., radio frequency identification [RFID] implementations and/or other unique identifiers which could include, but not be limited to: fingerprints, hand geometry, earlobe geometry, retina and iris patterns, voice waves, DNA, and signatures which could allow for almost instantaneous personal identification that could be used separately, as a pair, or three or more collectively). One or more of these means could be employed to generally allow the operator, gaming establishment or authorized personnel (e.g., the dealer, pit boss, etc.) to pass through one or more security lockout measures of the computer system <b>38</b> to gain access to the electronic gaming table <b>22</b> via the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> or any remote computer.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0206">In this manner, the computer system <b>38</b> could identify (and possibly record for reporting purposes) the individual operating (or generally having control over or logged into) a remote terminal, the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>, and/or a dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> on a particular table.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0207">Once a dealer, pit boss, or other personnel authorized by the gaming establishment has been identified by the invention <b>10</b>, these people could be given certain unrestricted capabilities by the gaming establishment or the operator, which may include, but not be limited to: to remove the currency from the table (e.g., the bill validator cashbox); authorize various types of overrides based on standardized computer security schemas (e.g., the pit boss could have certain override capabilities that may include, but not be limited by, the ability to re-boot an individual gaming table and/or certain gaming table components; to transfer a player's or players' current game/game status/gaming history/and the like to a specific gaming table; to fix a dealer's/player's data-entry error; to credit a player's account in the case of a system malfunction/player dispute; and the like); and the like. These capabilities could give the operator and the gaming establishment, a record of activity that provides an extra layer of security needed in the event someone has tampered with the invention <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0208">For the player to be recognized by the invention <b>10</b>, the player (after deciding to participate in the action of the electronic gaming table <b>22</b>) could begin by deciding which player position <b>40</b> (e.g., a vacant player position/seat) that he/she wishes to occupy at the electronic gaming table <b>22</b> or by choosing to participate in a non-card gaming table by checking out a handheld wireless gaming device <b>130</b> somewhere within the gaming establishment. The player could identify his/her presence to the computer system <b>38</b> by inserting one or more devices that could be used to download electronic game play credits onto the electronic gaming table <b>22</b>. These devices could be, but not be limited to, a smart card, a player's club card, a ticket-in/ticket-out ticket, currency, and the like into the one or more player's monetary devices <b>34</b>. Other options that could be used to convert currency into electronic game play credits or to read the bar code on a ticket-ticket-out ticket, to read a player's club card, or to read a smart card could include one or more surface computing types of platforms (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#x2122; and the like). At this point, the player has loaded the electronic gaming table <b>22</b> and/or a handheld wireless gaming device <b>130</b> with electronic game play credits.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0209">In at least one embodiment, if a player chooses not to participate in the gaming establishments player's club card or smart card program(s), the system could be programmed to still recognize the player's presence via their interaction with the players monetary device (e.g., by inserting currency). The computer system <b>38</b> could process that a player is present at the player's position, but not necessarily pairing the player with a particular player's database identification file/profile/data file.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0210">In at least one embodiment, the use of a player's club card or smart card in the compounds of this invention <b>10</b> could be programmed to automatically qualify players to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, with or without a cap. This practice could encourage players to participate in the gaming establishment's players club card and/or smart card program, thus enhancing the gaming establishment's ability to mine data related to the players' gaming patterns and behaviors.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0211">After step <b>506</b> has been substantially completed, the process <b>500</b> could generally proceed to step <b>508</b>, Player Places Wagers and Inputs Supplemental Game Play Responses Via the One or More Player's Electronic Interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0212">At step <b>508</b>, Player Places Wagers and Inputs Supplemental Game Play Responses Via the One or More Player's Electronic Interfaces, the could now use his or her electronic game play credits to place a wager via the one or more player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b>. The player could also input supplemental game play responses (e.g., touching which playing cards to split, selecting to buy insurance, and the like) via the same one or more player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b>. These one or more player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b>, in at least one embodiment of the invention <b>10</b>, could be a touch screen <b>48</b> similar to the ones used by the dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0213">The player's electronic interfaces <b>32</b> could offer a player several different options. These options may include, but not be limited to: using electronic game play credits to wager; inputting data (either directly or indirectly) into the computer system <b>38</b>; receiving data from the computer system <b>38</b>(<i>s</i>); placing one or more wagers at once; playing one or more hands at once; repeating a wager without having to manually type in the amount; cashing out; accessing help; being the table's banker; buying insurance; splitting playing cards; doubling down; choosing the number of hands to play; tipping the dealer; selecting the Off option (e.g., in craps); viewing the credit counter; betting on the dealer, the player, and/or a tie; and other options (e.g., non-gaming options); and the like. After step <b>508</b> is substantially completed the process could proceed to step <b>510</b>, Playing Through the Dealer's Electronic Interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0214">In step <b>510</b>, Playing Through the Dealer's Electronic Interfaces, the dealer commences game play utilizing the dealer's electronic interface (and other devices). Before any player's begins game play on an electronic gaming table <b>22</b>, the players have already inserted one or more of the following items into the player's monetary device <b>34</b>: their player's club cards or smart card, currency, one or more ticket-in-ticket-out tickets, etc., and the players have placed a bet (e.g., wager).</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0215">One possible embodiment could be applied to the playing card table games of blackjack, pai gow, and/or baccarat. The dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> (e.g., touch-screen) could be used, but not be limited to, the following functionality example: This example assumes that there are two players at the table. These two players are seated at positions 1 (Player 1) and 4 (Player 4).</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0216">After the playing cards have been shuffled and placed in the card-recognition system's shoe (e.g., iShoe), the dealer could begin by touching or pressing the PLAYER #1: HAND #1 button (e.g., icon and the like) on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. Next, the dealer could remove the first playing card from the shoe, and deals it to player 1. Next, the dealer could touch or press the PLAYER #4: HAND #1 button (e.g., icon and the like). The dealer could then remove the second playing card from the shoe and deals it to player 4. Next, the dealer could then touch or press the DEALER'S HAND button (e.g., icon and the like). The dealer could then remove a playing card from the shoe and deals the third playing card to himself/herself. The second round of dealing could then begin by repeating the aforementioned steps: the dealer touching or pressing the PLAYER #1: HAND #1 button (e.g., icon and the like), removing the fourth playing card from the shoe, and dealing the playing card to player 1. Touching or pressing the PLAYER #4: HAND #1 button (e.g., icon and the like), removing the fifth playing card from the shoe, and dealing the playing card to player 4. Touching or pressing the DEALER'S HAND button (e.g., icon and the like), removing the sixth playing card from the shoe, and dealing it to himself or herself.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0217">For the table games embodiments of the invention <b>10</b> for baccarat and pai gow, after all of the necessary playing cards have been dealt, the game could be considered over. The rules of baccarat and pai gow dictate that, after the playing cards have been dealt, the player has no decision-making abilities (e.g., to discard, ask for additional playing cards, split a hand, and the like); therefore, the identification of winning hands are based upon standard game rules and are immutable and automatic. The electronic gaming system could be programmed by those skilled in the art to automatically match a player's hand to that of the dealer and automatically identify the winning hand(s), and the system could then automatically debit or credit the players' game credit amounts accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0218">For the blackjack embodiments of the invention <b>10</b>, however, the players have some decision-making capabilities (e.g., to discard, ask for additional playing cards, split a hand, and the like). If and when this occurs, the players could request additional playing cards with the traditional verbal/nonverbal communications (e.g., &#x201c;Hit me!&#x201d;). The dealer could then respond by repeating this &#x201c;touch or press button (e.g., icon and the like)/deal process&#x201d; over and over again until all of the players at the table are satisfied with the final result of their hand(s). At this point, the dealer could be obligated to reveal his or her face down playing card. Prior to flipping over his or her playing card, the dealer could then touch or press the DEALER'S REVEAL button (e.g., icon and the like). This button (e.g., icon and the like) could be used to communicate to the electronic gaming system that all the playing cards have been dealt to the players and that the dealer could now reveal his or her facedown playing card. If, after revealing the dealer's face down playing card, the dealer requires additional playing cards, the dealer could touch or press the DEALER'S HAND button (e.g., icon and the like) and then deals himself or herself a playing card. The dealer could repeat this process until, according to in-house rules, the dealer reaches 17 or &#x201c;busts&#x201d; (e.g., goes over 21 in points). The electronic gaming system could (by those with ordinary skill in the art) automatically recognize who has the winning hand(s) and could automatically debit or credit the players' accounts accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0219">Another embodiment could have players who choose to play multiple hands using the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. This embodiment could also be applied to the table games of blackjack, pai gow, and/or baccarat (in the event the gaming establishment's house rules permit/allow).</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0220">For this embodiment, there is one player at the table who is seated at position 1 (Player 1) and who has decided to play two hands simultaneously. The player has indicated this decision both by touching and/or pressing the NUMBER OF HANDS button (e.g., icon and the like) and the number 2 button (e.g., icon and the like) on his/her dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> and by verbally indicating this decision to the dealer (e.g., &#x201c;I wish to play two hands.&#x201d;). After the playing cards have been shuffled and placed in the card-recognition system's shoe (e.g., iShoe), the dealer could begin by touching or pressing the PLAYER #1: HAND #1 button (e.g., icon and the like) on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. The dealer could then remove the first playing card from the shoe (e.g., iShoe) and deal it to player 1 for the first hand. The dealer could then touch or press the PLAYER #1: HAND #2 button (e.g., icon and the like), remove the second playing card from the shoe, and deal it to player 1 for the second hand. The dealer could then touch or press the DEALER'S HAND button (e.g., icon and the like), remove a playing card from the shoe, and deal the third playing card to himself or herself. The second round of dealing could copy the first round's dealing action with the dealer repeating this &#x201c;touch or press button (e.g., icon and the like) and deal process&#x201d; over and over again until all of the playing cards for the player's two hands have been dealt. After all of the playing cards have been dealt, the dealer could reveal his or her facedown playing card using the same actions as stated earlier in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0221">This next example will attempt to illustrate the process of dealing, using the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>, to a player who has chosen to split his or her first two playing cards into two separate hands. This example could be applied to the table game of blackjack (in the event the gaming establishment's house rules permit/allow this action).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0222">In this scenario, there is one player at the table who is seated at position 1 (Player 1). The player has been dealt two playing cards of the same value (e.g., two aces) and has decided to split the hand by touching or pressing the SPLIT button (e.g., icon and the like) on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. When the player selects this option, the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> may display a confirmation prompt asking the player if he or she wishes to split the two playing cards, thereby creating two separate hands. The player could select either the YES or the NO button (e.g., icon and the like) (e.g., in this example, the player would select YES), and the electronic gaming system could automatically place a bet of equal value (e.g., equal to the original hand's bet) on the newly created hand. As traditional blackjack game play dictates, the player could then flip over both playing cards face up to indicate to the dealer that the player wishes to split the hand (this action may be conveyed either verbally or non-verbally as well). During this process, the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could indicate that the player is now playing two hands (e.g., PLAYER 1, HAND 1 and PLAYER 1, HAND 2). The dealer could then touch or press the PLAYER #1: HAND #1 button (e.g., icon and the like) on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>, and deal it to the player's first hand (e.g., completing the player's first hand). The dealer could then touch or press the PLAYER #1: HAND #2 button (e.g., icon and the like), remove the second playing card from the shoe, and deal it to the same player to complete the second hand. After all of the playing cards have been dealt, the dealer could reveal his or her facedown playing card using the same actions as stated earlier in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0223">For the embodiments where the player is allowed to be a banker (e.g., take the role of the dealer on a pai gow and/or a baccarat table), the dealer could press or touch the PLAYER AS DEALER button (e.g., icon and the like) to allow a specified player to have its respective dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> present a dealer's display showing the respective individual player menus to allow the player (who has now become the banker/dealer) to deal the playing cards and activate the respective selections to indicate to the computer system <b>38</b> which players and/or himself/herself (e.g., the player as dealer) the respective playing card(s) could be dealt. Once the PLAYER AS DEALER option has been selected by the dealer, the computer system <b>38</b> could ask the dealer to select which player (e.g., Player 1) has requested to play the role of the dealer for the next upcoming round of play. By selecting which player could be taking on the role of dealer, the computer system <b>38</b> could automatically transfer control of the game to the selected player (e.g., meanwhile, the electronic gaming system could be programmed so that the default dealer could retain sufficient command of the system in order to take back control of the dealer/banker capability and to move this capability back to the himself or herself or to transfer this capability to another player).</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0224">The player utilizing the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> (or a player as banker using the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>) could activate the proper selection (as generally described above) to indicate which player (e.g., player position <b>40</b>) could receive the next playing card, or next set of playing cards (e.g., pai gow or baccarat). The player as banker could then remove from the game element reader <b>36</b> (e.g., the Shufflemaster&#xae; iShoe&#x2122;) a playing card, or a plurality of playing cards, which would then be dealt to the player at the players' positions (which have been previously identified to the invention <b>10</b> [to further associate the read playing cards as going to the appropriate respective players]). The player as banker could then physically transfer the dealt playing card(s) to the appropriate respective players. The player as banker could repeat this action for the remaining players at the table. The player as banker could then deal to him or herself after identifying to the invention <b>10</b> that the player as banker was the next recipient of the next dealt playing card(s) (by touching/pressing the &#x201c;DEALER'S HAND&#x201d; button [e.g., icon and the like]). This set of actions could be repeated until all the playing cards (or set of playing cards) had been dealt in the round (including multiple hands, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0225">When a player takes on the role of banker/dealer, the computer system <b>38</b> could be programmed to have his or her account automatically credit or debit the other remaining players' (e.g., those that are actively participating in the normal game play at that table) accounts based upon the outcome of each round of game play.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0226">The computer system <b>38</b> could have the ability to evaluate the account of the player who wishes to become the banker/dealer to determine whether or not the player (who wishes to take on the role/responsibility of the banker/dealer) has sufficient funds in his/her account to cover any possible bets placed on the table for the next round(s) of game play. This evaluation could be based upon several pieces of criteria (e.g., the average wager amount that has been bet on that one table for the past several hands). If the computer system <b>38</b> determines that such a player has insufficient funds for such activity, the system could automatically notify the gaming establishment's gaming employee (e.g., the dealer) that transference of the banker/dealer role could not be wise and access could be denied.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0227">When a player takes on the role of banker/dealer, there could be a safeguard in place for the default dealer to have the ability to take back control, as the dealer, during the course of a game. It is recommended that a DEALER'S OVERRIDE button (e.g., icon and the like) be installed on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> which could allow the dealer to take control of the table as a dealer either when a player is finished with his or her turn of being the game's banker or in the event of a system malfunction/player error during the player's turn of being the game's banker.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0228">Craps</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0229">For the embodiments of the invention <b>10</b> for playing craps, the known positions of the craps players are not important to the dealer(s) as a player may place a bet on any number and any combination or line (e.g., Pass, Don't Pass, Come and Don't Come) from any location on the table utilizing their player's electronic interface or from any handheld wireless gaming device <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0230">A new game begins with a shooter (e.g., the player who rolls the dice) rolling the dice for the purpose of making a &#x201c;point number.&#x201d; It is understood (for those players who are knowledgeable with the rules of craps) that the &#x201c;point number&#x201d; is any number other than 2, 3 and/or 12. Although achieving a &#x201c;point number&#x201d; is not necessary in betting on, winning, or losing in the game of craps. It should be understood (to those players who are knowledgeable with the rules of craps), this &#x201c;point number&#x201d; is merely the number on which players bet that the shooter may or may not roll again before rolling the number 7. When a shooter has rolled the &#x201c;point number,&#x201d; the dealer could respond by pressing the &#x201c;POINT NUMBER&#x201d; button (e.g., icon and the like) on his or her dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) followed by the number that was rolled. For example, if a shooter rolls the number 4 at the beginning of the game, the dealer could press the &#x201c;POINT NUMBER&#x201d; button (e.g., icon and the like) and then the number 4 button. If, on the first roll of the dice, the shooter rolls a 2, 3, or 12, the dealer could respond by pressing the coinciding number on his dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> (e.g., this number entry is not preceded with the &#x201c;POINT NUMBER&#x201d; button [e.g., icon and the like]) entry. After a &#x201c;point number&#x201d; has been rolled by the shooter (e.g., the player who rolls the dice), the dealer could respond to each roll of the dice by pressing the coinciding number button on his or her dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> and retrieving the dice so that the shooter could roll again.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0231">The dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b> could also include buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) with specific number combinations (e.g., two 2s, two 3s, two 4s, two 5s [e.g., &#x201c;the hard ways&#x201d;] in addition to two 1's [e.g., snake eyes] and two 6's). In addition, other buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) could be included on the dealer's electronic interface <b>30</b>. These buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) could include, but not be limited to, ON, OFF, and PIT BOSS. The ON and OFF buttons <b>50</b> could be used to assist the dealer in effectively facilitating when players could and could not place bets (e.g., wagers). By touching or pressing one of these two buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like), the computer system <b>38</b> could send one of two messages to all players on their one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> and/or handheld wireless gaming devices <b>130</b>. The first message (which is sent when the dealer presses the ON button [e.g., icon and the like]) could be that bets (e.g., wagers) may now be allowed and encouraged; the second message (which is sent when the dealer presses the OFF button [e.g., icon and the like] could be that bets (e.g., wagers) are temporarily suspended. This OFF button (e.g., icon and the like) could prevent players from placing a bet (e.g., wager) after the dealer and the players have seen the results of game play and before a dealer could react by recording the results of game play. Other options for buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) could include PIT BOSS, which, when pressed, could send a signal to the pit boss in order to inform him or her that the dealer needs assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0232">During game play, a player is able place all kinds of bets and place one or more bets simultaneously during the course of a game. As the player places a bet on their dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>) or handheld gaming device (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) and after the dealer has entered any number that has been rolled by the shooter into the one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b>, the computer system <b>38</b> could be programmed (by those with ordinary skilled in the art) to record all bets (e.g. wagers), whether it be one bet (e.g., wager) or more bets (e.g., wagers) in a series and then credit and/or debit each player's account in reference to each individual bet (e.g., wager) after each round of game play. The game ends when the shooter has rolled the number 7; however, wagering can still continue regardless of the round being over (e.g., &#x201c;the hard ways&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0233">Roulette</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0234">For the roulette embodiments of the invention <b>10</b><i>s</i>, after all players have placed their bets, the dealer launches the ball and waits for the ball to drop and land on a number. Once the ball has landed, the dealer enters the number that the ball has landed upon into the one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b>. At this point, the electronic gaming table <b>22</b> could automatically debit or credit the player's accounts accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0235">In addition, other buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) could be programmed into the system to appear on the one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). These buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) could include, but not be limited to, ON, OFF, and PIT BOSS. The ON and OFF buttons <b>50</b> could be used to assist the dealer in effectively facilitating when players could and could not place bets (e.g., wagers). By pressing one of these two buttons <b>50</b>, the computer system <b>38</b> could send one of two messages to all players on their one or more dealer's electronic interfaces <b>30</b> and/or handheld wireless gaming devices <b>130</b>. The first message (which is sent when the dealer presses the ON button (e.g., icon and the like) could be that bets (e.g., wagers) may now be allowed and encouraged; the second message (which is sent when the dealer presses the OFF (e.g., icon and the like) could be that bets (e.g., wagers) are temporarily suspended. This OFF button (e.g., icon and the like) could prevent players from placing a bet (e.g., wager) after the dealer and the players have seen the results of game play and before a dealer could react by recording the results of game play.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0236">Other options for buttons <b>50</b> (e.g., icons <b>52</b> and the like) could include PIT BOSS which, when pressed, could send a signal to the pit boss in order to inform him or her that the dealer needs assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0237">After substantial completion of step <b>510</b>, the process could proceed to step <b>512</b>, The Two Phases of the Cap Winning Cycle Mode.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0238">In step <b>512</b>, The Two Phases of the Cap Winning Cycle Mode, if so desired by the operator, steps <b>512</b> through <b>542</b> could be programmed into the computer system <b>38</b> to add a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot to the invention <b>10</b>. If desired by the operator, a cap could also be added, by those with ordinary skill in the art, to the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0239">In step <b>512</b>, could be utilized if the computer system <b>38</b> is operating with a cap (e.g., the maximum allowable payout amount that a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could reach [e.g., 100 million dollars]).

<p id="p-0226" num="0250">In step <b>528</b>, The Single/Multi-tier Progressive Bonus Jackpot is Renewed, If the predetermined winning criteria has been achieved (e.g., the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has been &#x201c;hit&#x201d; or &#x201c;won&#x201d;) during the timed predetermined winning cycle, the computer system <b>38</b> could cause the countdown timer (if a timer is applicable) to reset (e.g., until an initiation predetermined winning wager occurs, the timer could remain at zero. After the initiation predetermined winning wager, the timer could reset to a predetermined fixed period of time [if a timer is deemed appropriate]). The computer system <b>38</b> could then broadcast information (e.g., visually or audibly) about the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout (e.g., once a player, or a plurality of players, has obtained the predetermined winning criteria needed to be awarded the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, the win has been verified [by the operator, the system, and any other gaming or legal personnel deemed necessary], and the player's/players' identity/identities have been confirmed [by the operator, the system, and any other gaming or legal personnel deemed necessary], the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could be paid out [e.g., from the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot account to the accounts of the winning player's/winning players' through the one or more player's/players' electronic interfaces] to a player or a plurality of players in the form of an annuity or a reduced lump sum [whichever the player/players choose]), then shut down the broadcast means; clear the winning pool (e.g., clear the winning player(s) ID(s) and the player(s) position data [this data can be archived]); reseed the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (e.g., 7 million); and begin again to collect a small percentage of each wager, which could be earmarked (or any other similar monetary pooling methods which could be implemented) for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap). The computer system <b>38</b> could then reset itself to await the occurrence of the next initiation predetermined winning wager. The computer system <b>38</b> could then proceed to Step <b>512</b>: &#x201c;The Two Phases of the Cap Winning Cycle Mode&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0251">In step <b>530</b>, Initiate the First Phase of the Cap Winning Cycle Mode, as stated in previous embodiments, if the operator decides to implement a cap (e.g., the maximum allowable payout amount that a single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could reach [e.g., 100 million dollars]), then a two-phase cap winning cycle mode could be introduced as a means to facilitate the actions or steps of the cap and as a supplement to the regular winning cycle mode which, when introduced, this mode could start once the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout has reached a certain level, amount, or cap and could end the regular winning cycle mode when a predetermined cap to the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has been reached. The first phase of this cap winning cycle mode could last for a brief period of time (e.g., 24 hours). Once the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot reaches the pre-determined cap amount, the system could automatically switch to the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode. In this first phase of the cap winning cycle mode, the funds being collected for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could be diverted into a temporary supplemental or surplus account (thereby making the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot's amount static). This two-phase cap winning cycle mode could be applied to all gaming tables regardless of the choice of game element <b>26</b>. The cap could conclude, at any time (e.g., the time period could be any amount of time that the operator desires) or terminate with one or more players winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot. This two-phase cap winning cycle mode could be comprised of a first (e.g., initiating) phase and a second phase. When the first phase is initiated, the computer system <b>38</b> could perform a series of functions (e.g., actions or tasks) in a specific amount of time (e.g., 24 hours) before automatically engaging the second phase. One of the many functions (e.g., actions or tasks) of a cap winning cycle mode in its first phase could be, but not be limited to, holding the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout at its cap level and then immediately divert any and all additional funds that are received during the cap winning cycle mode into a temporary second or surplus account. Another function (e.g., action or task) that could immediately be set into motion upon the activation of the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode could be, to activate a cap countdown timer (e.g., counting down a predetermined fixed period of time [if a timer is deemed appropriate]) to determine if and when the second phase could be initiated. In addition, another function (e.g., actions or tasks) that could be placed in motion by the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode could include all means of communication that might be introduced throughout the gaming establishment (e.g., visual, audible, and other medias) regarding the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot and its metamorphosis toward the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode (e.g., The count down could be visually displayed/audibly announced in the gaming establishment so that the precise moment of switching from the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode to the second phase could be recorded in the computer system <b>38</b> with a system-endorsed, computerized date/time stamp). Another function (e.g., action or task) of the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode could be to motivate the gaming establishment to bring additional electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> online (e.g., made operative in the gaming establishment to handle the surge in anticipated game play activity when the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode is activated). After the computer system <b>38</b> has determined that all of the functions (e.g., actions or tasks) of the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode have been exhausted and the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has not been awarded, the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode could be engaged but not before the computer system <b>38</b> proceeds onto Step <b>532</b>: Has the Conditions for Any Timed Predetermined Winning Criteria Been Met?&#x201d;</p>

If, after an initiation predetermined winning wager has been achieved, and, if a plurality of predetermined winning wagers is made prior to the timer countdown ending (if a countdown is applicable) (e.g., the predetermined winning criteria has been met), the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap) could be paid out (e.g., from the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot account) to a player or a plurality of players in the form of an annuity or a reduced lump sum (whichever the player/players choose).

If the occurrence of the series of predetermined winning criteria wagers (e.g., three sets of snake-eyes winning wagers for craps) does not occur before the countdown timer (if a timer is applicable) finishes its countdown, then the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap) may not be awarded to any player/players.

Once the countdown timer (if a timer is applicable) has completed its countdown without the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap) being won, then the computer system <b>38</b> could cause the countdown timer (if a timer is applicable) to reset (e.g., until an initiation predetermined winning wager occurs, the timer could remain at zero. After the initiation predetermined winning wager, the timer could reset to a predetermined fixed period of time [if a timer is deemed appropriate]); communicate information (e.g., a short announcement or broadcast through visual and/or auditory means) regarding the ending of the regular winning cycle mode; and clear the winning pool (e.g., clear the data [e.g., player IDs and player position data] [this data could be archived] of those player(s) that have been entered into a pool of those individuals who have placed and won one or more predetermined winning criteria wagers). The computer system <b>38</b> could then proceed to Step <b>540</b>: &#x201c;Initiate the Second Phase of the Cap Winning Cycle Mode&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0256">In step <b>540</b>, Initiate the Second Phase of the Cap Winning Cycle Mode. As the first phase cap countdown draws down to its end, thereby signaling the end of the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode and the beginning of the second phase, the gaming establishment could temporarily suspend gaming activity (both playing and wagering activities) on the computer system <b>38</b> in order to allow a recitation of a &#x201c;countdown&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;TEN!, NINE!, EIGHT!, etc) by the players and potential players in proximity to the electronic gaming tables <b>22</b> in order to generally add more anticipatory excitement (e.g., a party like atmosphere) to the gaming environment. This countdown could also be simultaneously visually displayed and/or audibly announced in the gaming establishment so that the precise moment of switching from the first phase of the cap winning cycle mode to the second phase could be recorded in the computer system <b>38</b> with a system-endorsed, computerized date/time stamp. If the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot is not won prior to the suspension of the gaming activity and after completion of the &#x201c;countdown,&#x201d; the cap winning cycle mode could then proceed to the second phase of the cap winning cycle mode. After the cap winning cycle mode has entered into the second phase, it may remain in this mode until the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has been awarded. Throughout this cycle, it is possible, by those with ordinary skill in the art, to broadcast communication through a wide variety of means(s) (e.g., visually, audibly, and via other medias) to players and potential players regarding any updates about the predetermined winning criteria (e.g., when this predetermined winning criteria may change and any other details associated with it). During this phase, if the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot is not awarded in a reasonable amount of time, the operator could have the option of making the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot progressively easier to win through either a timed or a non-timed predetermined winning cycle. The increasingly easier method to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could be set so that the odds of winning could increasingly favor the players over time (e.g., in increments of hours, days, weeks, months, a year, and the like). This criteria could be accomplished by a variety of means such as progressively reducing, over a period or periods of time, the number and/or types of predetermined winning criteria needed to win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (e.g., going from needing ten types of predetermined winning criteria to four types of predetermined winning criteria and the like), thus changing the odds needed to win from a low probability (e.g., a low chance of winning/highest odds against the player) to a medium probability (e.g., a medium chance of winning/50/50 odds) to a high change of probability (e.g., a high chance of a player or players winning the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot) and the like; or other means and various combinations of such means. Another illustration of how the odds of winning could increasingly favor the players over time could be the transitioning of the timed predetermined winning cycle (in accordance with regulatory and jurisdictional laws and regulations) to a non-timed predetermined winning cycle so that, in one round of game play, a player could easily win the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot. Once a player, or a plurality of players, has obtained the predetermined winning criteria needed to be awarded the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, the win has been verified (by the operator, the system, and any other gaming or legal personnel deemed necessary), and the player's/players' identity/identities have been confirmed (by the operator, the system, and any other gaming or legal personnel deemed necessary), the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could be paid out (e.g., from the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot account to the accounts of the winning player's/winning players' through the one or more player's/players' electronic interfaces) to a player or a plurality of players in the form of an annuity or a reduced lump sum (whichever the player/players choose). At this point, the computer system <b>38</b> could automatically proceed to Step <b>542</b>: The Single/Multi-tier Progressive Bonus Jackpot is Renewed&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0257">In step <b>542</b>, The Single/Multi-tier Progressive Bonus Jackpot is Renewed. If the predetermined winning criteria has been achieved (e.g., the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot has been &#x201c;hit&#x201d; or &#x201c;won&#x201d;) during the timed predetermined winning cycle (during the first or second phase of the cap winning cycle mode), the computer system <b>38</b> could cause the countdown timer (if a timer is applicable) to reset (e.g., until an initiation predetermined winning wager occurs, the timer could remain at zero. After the initiation predetermined winning wager, the timer could reset to a predetermined fixed period of time [if a timer is deemed appropriate]). The computer system <b>38</b> could then broadcast information about the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot payout (e.g., once a player, or a plurality of players, has obtained the predetermined winning criteria needed to be awarded the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot, the win has been verified [by the operator, the system, and any other gaming or legal personnel deemed necessary], and the player's/players' identity/identities have been confirmed [by the operator, the system, and any other gaming or legal personnel deemed necessary], the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot could be paid out [e.g., from the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot account to the accounts of the winning player's/winning players' through the one or more player's/players' electronic interfaces] to a player or a plurality of players in the form of an annuity or a reduced lump sum [whichever the player/players choose]), then shut down the broadcast means; clear the winning pool (e.g., clear the winning player(s) ID(s) and the player(s) position data [this data can be archived]); reseed the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (e.g., 7 million); begin again to collect a small percentage of each wager, which could be earmarked (or any other similar monetary pooling methods which could be implemented) for the single/multi-tier progressive bonus jackpot (with or without a cap), and clear the winning pool (e.g., deleting the winning player(s) ID(s) and the player(s) position data [this data can be archived]). The computer system <b>38</b> could then reset itself to await the occurrence of the next initiation predetermined winning wager.
